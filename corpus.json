    "content": "Just one stumbling block for one migrant? Or something much more serious which threatens the government's approach to small boats?\nThose are the questions being posed in government now after a 25-year-old Eritrean man managed to block the government from putting him on a flight to France at the High Court on Tuesday.\nIt is just a temporary decision. The judge granted a pause of at least 14 days so the man, who is not being named for legal reasons and arrived in the UK on a small boat last month, could provide evidence of his claim that he has been a victim of modern day slavery.\nBut it is certainly frustrating for a government which had hoped that the removal flights to France under the 'one in, one out' scheme would begin this week. They may still do so. Either way, the steady drumbeat of people being put on flights through the week appears not to have materialised.\nThe stumbling blocks with Tuesday's case show how complicated quick turn-around deportation or removal plans can be.\nAnd in this case, they concern the UK's laws on modern day slavery and trafficking - and the way the Home Office handles these cases.\nAfter the man arrived on a small boat in August, officials swiftly rejected his case and told him he could and should have claimed asylum in France.\nBut he also asked for protection as a victim of modern day slavery, saying he has suffered harm in Libya, long before he came to the UK.\nThere was no evidence he was trafficked across the Channel, not least because his mother had paid smugglers about £1,000 to take him.\nNow, here's the important twist.\nThe Home Office's trafficking assessors - different officials to the team organising removal flights - said the Eritrean man's story was weak.\nBut that rejection was not their final decision. The UK's rules allow a rejected applicant to ask for a reconsideration.\nThe senior judge dealing with the case repeatedly asked the man's lawyers why he could not make those representations from France, including gathering any medical evidence.\nIt looked and sounded like the Home Office was going to win. But then, as the courtroom battle dragged on, the department's own trafficking officials effectively confirmed that they would not expect the man to do that.\nThat fatally undermined any hope the home secretary had of getting this 25-year-old on the 9am flight from London Heathrow.\nIf the Home Office wasn't such a secure bomb-proof building, we might have been able to hear howls from its ministerial corridors echo around the Royal Courts of Justice, two miles away.\nSo where does this decision leave the project?\nThis single decision does not kill the France returns plan, but it's symptomatic of a decades-long criticism, that the Home Office regularly snatches defeat from the jaws of victory thanks to epic levels of dysfunction.\nYes, the government never committed publicly to flights in the air this week. But in private, there was a strong expectation from those around Shabana Mahmood, the new home secretary, of a string of departures this week.\nBut immigration is complicated - really complicated - and the awkwardness of Tuesday's injunction aside, officials know other English Channel crossers may mount similar arguments.\nThe government's own KC argued in court that if the judge blocked this removal, as he went on to do, then \"the deterrent effect of this policy will be undermined\".\nAnyone who presents a reasonable argument that they might have been a victim of trafficking is entitled to at least 45 days to \"recover and reflect\" - with a final decision on their case maybe a year down the road. If this claimant gets that positive decision, he could be off the removal list for a year on top of that as he waits a final outcome.\nThe political risk for the government is that their own lawyer is now proved right, not least because so many arriving on small boats have travelled through countries like Libya where trafficking and abuse are rife.\nIt is too soon to say conclusively whether Tuesday's interim judgment means that this scheme will get bogged down in repeated legal action like the Conservatives' proposed Rwanda policy, which never got off the ground before being cancelled by Sir Keir Starmer 14 months ago when he entered office.\nThe Conservatives, though, see vindication in the development. Their leader, Kemi Badenoch, told LBC that her message for the government was: \"We told you so.\"\nScience Secretary Liz Kendall told BBC Breakfast that scheme was not intended as a \"silver bullet\" and this single ruling would \"not stop this really important deal from going ahead\".\nThe deal with France was seen by the previous home secretary, Yvette Cooper, as one of her landmark policy achievements, it is now the job of her successor, Mahmood, to make it work.\nMahmood is seen at the government as a punchier communicator - displayed, perhaps, in her opening vow as home secretary to do \"whatever it takes\" to tackle illegal immigration.\nHer colleagues will be hoping she is not having to deploy those communication skills at the end of the week to explain why no-one has been flown to France yet.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond."

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx270y1rgzeo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "Thousands of Palestinians are continuing to flee Gaza City, as Israel's major ground offensive aimed at occupying the area enters a second day. Israel says its aim is to free hostages held by Hamas and defeat up to 3,000 fighters in what it describes as the group's \"last stronghold\", but the offensive has drawn widespread international condemnation.\nThe leaders of more than 20 major aid agencies, including Save the Children and Oxfam, warned that \"the inhumanity of the situation in Gaza is unconscionable\". It comes a day after a UN commission of inquiry concluded that Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza - an allegation the Israeli government strongly denied.\nAmid large-scale Israeli bombardment, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said al-Rantisi children's hospital in Gaza City was targeted in three separate Israeli attacks on Tuesday night, prompting around half its patients to leave. A source at the hospital said there were no injuries but that air conditioning units, water tanks and solar panels were severely damaged. \"This hospital is the only specialist facility for children with cancer, kidney failure, and other life-threatening conditions,\" said Fikr Shalltoot, Gaza director of the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was looking into the reports. The IDF announced on Wednesday morning that it had struck more than 150 targets across Gaza City in two days in support of its ground troops. As part of its operations, the IDF is also reportedly utilising old military vehicles loaded with explosives that have been modified to be controlled remotely. They are being driven to Hamas positions and detonated, according to Israeli media. Resident Nidal al-Sherbi told the BBC Arabic's Middle East Daily programme: \"Last night was extremely difficult, with continuous explosions and shelling that lasted from night until dawn.\"\n\"Israeli vehicles advanced from Sheikh Radwan, Tal al-Hawa, and also from Shejaiya. It was a very, very frightening night.\"\nFor days - as Israel has ramped up strikes in and around the city - huge columns of Palestinians have streamed southwards in donkey carts, rickshaws, vehicles strapped high with belongings, and on foot.\nUntil now, they have been forced to flee down the main coastal road to an Israel-designated \"humanitarian area\" in al-Mawasi.\nBut on Wednesday, the IDF announced that it would temporarily open a second route for people to travel on - the central Salah al-Din road. It said the route would be open for 48 hours from 12:00 local time (10:00 BST).\nMany Palestinians say they are unable to move south due to the rising costs associated with the journey. Some say renting a small truck now costs the equivalent of £660 ($900), while a tent for five people sells for about £880 ($1,200). Aid groups, UN agencies and others say the \"humanitarian area\" they are expected to move to is heavily overcrowded and insufficient to support the roughly two million Palestinians who are expected to cram into it.\nSome who followed the military's orders to evacuate to the zone say they found no space to pitch their tents and so returned north.\n\"Everyday leaflets are thrown at us ordering evacuation, while the Israeli army shells buildings in every direction,\" Munir Azzam, who is in northern Gaza, told the BBC. \"But where can we go? We have no refuge in the South.\"\nThe IDF said on Tuesday that around 350,000 people had fled Gaza City, while the UN put the figure at 190,000 since August. Estimates suggest at least 650,000 remain.\nGaza's health ministry said on Wednesday that 98 people had been killed and 385 injured by Israeli fire in the past 24 hours. Another four people had died from malnutrition, taking the total number of malnutrition-related deaths since a UN-backed body declared famine in Gaza City in late August to 154, it added. Meanwhile, families of the 48 remaining hostages held by Hamas - 20 of whom are believed to be alive - protested near Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem on Tuesday and Wednesday, arguing that the offensive would endanger their loved ones.\n\"All day long, you boast about killing and destruction,\" said Macabit Mayer, aunt of hostages Gali and Ziv Berman. \"Bringing down buildings in Gaza - who are you bringing these buildings down on?\"\nPope Leo XIV meanwhile said conditions for Palestinians in Gaza were \"unacceptable\" and repeated his call for a ceasefire.\n\"I am deeply close to the Palestinian people of Gaza, who continue to live in fear and under unacceptable conditions, forced yet again to leave their land,\" he told his weekly audience at the Vatican.\nElsewhere, the European Union's main executive body, the European Commission, proposed imposing sanctions on Israel over its conduct during the Gaza war and its decision to advance the E1 settlement project, which would effectively divide the occupied West Bank in two.\nThe proposal includes suspending some trade-related provisions of the EU's association agreement with Israel, as well as sanctions on \"extremist ministers\" in the Israeli government and violent Israeli settlers. The settlements are illegal under international law.\nIsrael has warned the EU not to impose the measures, which do not currently have sufficient support from member states to pass.\nAmong the findings of the UN commission of inquiry's report which concluded that Israel had committed genocide in Gaza was that Israeli security forces had perpetrated sexual and gender-based violence, directly targeted children with the intention to kill them, and carried out a \"systemic and widespread attack\" on religious, cultural and education sites.\nIsrael's foreign ministry said it categorically rejected the report, denouncing it as \"distorted and false\".\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 65,062 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since then, almost half of them women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry.\nWith famine having already been declared in Gaza City by a UN-backed food security body, the UN has warned that an intensification of the offensive will push civilians into \"even deeper catastrophe\".\nAdditional reporting by Rushdi Abualouf"

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8rndyyp7vo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "Plans to scrap Scotland's controversial not proven verdict have been approved by MSPs.\nThe move is part of wide-ranging justice reforms which will also increase the threshold for a guilty verdict in jury trials and create a special sexual offences court.\nThe removal of the not proven verdict, which is unique to Scottish courts and can be traced back to the 17th Century, will be a major milestone in the country's legal history.\nIts supporters argue that it reduces the risk of wrongful conviction – but critics say the verdict is confusing and fails to provide closure for victims.\nThe reforms were included in the government's Victims, Witnesses and Justice Reform (Scotland) Bill, which passed by 71 votes to 46.\nNot proven is one of three verdicts that can be returned in Scotland's criminal courts, alongside guilty and not guilty.\nIt has the same effect as being found not guilty - the accused is acquitted and is innocent in the eyes of the law.\nThere have been repeated calls to abolish not proven in recent decades, often prompted by families of victims who have been left aggrieved by what they perceive as an unfair verdict.\nThere is no set definition of not proven in law. At the start of a criminal trial, jurors are told that there are two acquittal verdicts - but it is not explained how they differ.\nJustice Secretary Angela Constance said it was a \"widely misunderstood\" verdict that \"traumatises\" victims and leaves a \"lingering stigma on the accused\".\nHowever, the Law Society of Scotland has argued that its removal risks an increase in miscarriages of justice.\nA study published in 2019 said removing the not proven verdict might incline more jurors towards a guilty verdict in finely balanced trials. It also highlighted inconsistent views on the meaning of not proven and how it differed from not guilty.\nThe latest Scottish government figures, for 2022/23, show that 1% of people facing criminal charges in court were acquitted on a not proven verdict, compared to 4% on a not guilty verdict.\nThe reforms in the government's bill also include a change in how guilty verdicts are decided.\nScottish juries have 15 members and at present a simple majority of eight jurors is required for a verdict. Under the new two-thirds rule, that will be raised to 10 out of 15 jurors.\nRaising the bar for guilty verdicts is intended to allay the concerns of some defence lawyers who fear the the abolition of the not proven verdict could increase the risk of wrongful convictions.\nThe reforms also pave the way for: Ministers have not set a timetable for scrapping the not proven verdict or introducing a two-thirds majority for guilty verdicts. These changes will require judges and court staff to undergo training.\nIt could take significantly longer to set up a sexual offences court and a victims commissioner.\nMost rape cases reported to police do not lead to prosecutions. To address this, ministers proposed a pilot scheme that would have allowed trials for serious sexual offences to be held without a jury and decided by a single judge.\nHowever, this measure was dropped following criticism from lawyers and judges.\nVictim Support Scotland chief executive Kate Wallace said the passage of the bill was a \"momentous occasion\".\n\"It marks a significant step towards creating a system that considers and prioritises the needs of people impacted by crime,\" she said. Rape Crisis chief executive Sandy Brindley welcomed the removal of the not proven verdict, which she said had \"let down\" victims.\nHowever, she also expressed \"serious concerns\" about the increase to the jury majority and \"the negative effect that this will almost certainly have on rape and sexual offence cases\".\nThe Law Society of Scotland said it supported the creation of a victims commissioner and the granting of automatic lifelong anonymity for victims of sexual offences.\nBut it warned that introducing \"untested\" changes to the justice system could raise the risk of miscarriages of justice. Stuart Munro, convener of the society's Criminal Law Committee, said: \"Every legal system with a two-verdict system requires a unanimous or near unanimous jury to convict, whereas Scotland will now have a system where a person can be convicted despite five members of the jury having significant doubts about their guilt.\"\nThe bill was supported by SNP, Liberal Democrat and Green MSPs. Constance said the legislation would \"put victims and witnesses at the heart of a modern and fair justice system\". Greens justice spokeswoman Maggie Chapman told MSPs it would help deliver \"compassion, dignity and justice for victims\".\nWhile there was broad agreement in parliament over abolishing the not proven verdict, Conservative and Labour MSPs voted against the bill.\nThey raised objections to pushing through such a wide range of measures in one bill and being given limited time to debate complex amendments.\nTory MSP Sharon Dowry said the legislation would \"waste millions on cosmetic solutions that will make little difference to victims\".\nLabour justice spokeswoman Pauline McNeill raised concerns about taking serious sexual offence cases out of the high court and into a specialist court.\nHer colleague Katy Clark added that the bill was \"far too large\" and that several amendments received too little scrutiny."

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dxge2ep4xo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "Former US President Barack Obama has warned of a \"political crisis of the sort that we haven't seen before\" in the wake of the killing of Charlie Kirk.\nAt an event in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, Obama said he did not know Kirk and disagreed with many of his views, but called the killing \"horrific and a tragedy\". He criticised Donald Trump's remarks towards his political opponents and pointed to previous Republican presidents who, he said, emphasised national unity in moments of high tension, US media report.\nIn response, the White House called Obama the \"architect of modern political division\".\nKirk, 31, died of a single gunshot wound while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem on 10 September.\nOn Tuesday, Tyler Robinson, 22, was formally charged with Kirk's murder, weapons offences and other charges. Prosecutors said they would seek the death penalty.\nUtah County Attorney Jeffrey Gray said Robinson had sent text messages which allegedly said he shot Kirk because he \"had enough of his hatred\".\nBefore Robinson was captured, top Trump allies pinned blame for the killing on left-wing activists and rhetoric from Democratic lawmakers and their supporters.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi has suggested that the administration will crack down on \"hate speech\" – although there is no specific US hate speech law. Vice-President JD Vance has led calls to expose people who celebrated or condoned Kirk's killing or were critical of him after his slaying.\n\"Call them out, and hell, call their employer,\" Vance said as he guest-hosted Kirk's podcast.\nSpeaking in Erie, Pennsylvania, Obama said: \"I think at moments like this, when tensions are high, then part of the job of the president is to pull people together.\" He urged Americans to \"respect other people's right to say things that we profoundly disagree with\".\nObama praised Utah Governor Spencer Cox, a conservative Republican who he said had shown \"that it is possible for us to disagree while abiding by a basic code of how we should engage in public debate\".\nHe also endorsed the response of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, whose official residence was firebombed earlier this year in what police called a targeted attack.\nThe former president contrasted those reactions with comments made by Trump and his allies.\nObama said that he did not use a 2015 mass shooting by a white supremacist at a black church in South Carolina to go after his political enemies, and pointed out that after the 11 September 2001 attacks, President George W Bush \"explicitly went out of his way to say, 'We are not at war against Islam'.\"\n\"And so when I hear not just our current president, but his aides, who have a history of calling political opponents 'vermin', enemies who need to be 'targeted,' that speaks to a broader problem that we have right now and something that we're going to have to grapple with, all of us,\" Obama told the crowd, according to reports.\nIn a statement to the BBC, a White House spokesperson rejected the allegations and accused Obama of stoking division while he was president. \"Obama used every opportunity to sow division and pit Americans against each other,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"His division has inspired generations of Democrats to slander their opponents as 'deplorables,' or 'fascists,' or 'Nazis.'\"\nAfter leaving office, US presidents generally tend to temper criticism of their successors, however in recent months Obama has hit out at Trump's moves against universities and judges, and has also criticised Democratic party leaders for failing to push back harder against White House policies."

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ye0x28vzqo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "The wife of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has said he was killed by poisoning while serving a prison sentence in an Arctic penal colony in 2024.\nIn a video shared on social media, Yulia Navalnaya said analysis of smuggled biological samples carried out by laboratories in two countries showed that her husband had been \"murdered\".\nShe did not provide details on the poison allegedly used, on the samples or on the analysis – but challenged the two laboratories to publish their results.\nNavalny – an anti-corruption campaigner and Russia's most vociferous opposition leader - died suddenly in jail on 16 February 2024 at the age of 47.\nIn 2020 he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. He underwent treatment in Germany, and was arrested at the airport upon his return to Russia.\nAt the time of his death he had been in jail for three years on trumped-up charges and had recently been transferred to a penal colony in the Arctic Circle.\nNavalny's supporters and colleagues at his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) have always maintained the Russian government was involved in his demise.\nNavalnaya said that after her husband's death in February 2024 his team were able to \"obtain and securely transfer\" biological samples abroad and that two laboratories in different countries had concluded he had been poisoned.\nShe did not share the location of the laboratories - but she implied that they were not making their findings public due to \"political considerations\".\n\"They don't want an inconvenient truth to surface at the wrong time,\" she said.\nNavalnaya also suggested she would get pushback on trying to investigate her husband's death further: \"'You are the wife, of course, but there is no criminal case, there are no legal grounds to hand documents to you.'\"\n\"But I have grounds. Not legal, but moral grounds.\"\nShe added that Navalny had been her husband, friend and closest person – and \"a symbol of hope for a better future for our country\".\n\"I know he was a symbol to you too,\" she said over images of Navalny's Moscow funeral which drew thousands despite warnings from the authorities not to attend.\n\"I will not be silent. I affirm that Vladimir Putin is guilty of killing my husband, Alexei Navalny... I urge the laboratories which conducted studies to make the results public.\"\nOn Wednesday Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was unaware of Navalnaya's statements.\nIn the video, Navalnaya also detailed her husband's last days based on what she said was testimony by employees at the penal colony, which the BBC has not been able to verify.\nAccording to her, on the day he died Navalny was taken out for a walk but felt ill. When he was taken back to his cell \"he lay down on the floor, pulled his knees up, and started moaning in pain... then he started vomiting\".\n\"Alexei was having convulsions... the prison guards watched [his] agony through the bars of the cell window,\" she said, citing the alleged testimonies.\nAn ambulance wasn't called until 40 minutes after Navalny became ill, his widow said, and he died shortly after. Prison authorities told his mother Lyudmila that her son had experienced \"sudden death syndrome\". Later, state investigators said the death had been caused by a medical condition and arrythmia.\nNavalny's associates have shared previously unseen images on social media purporting to show his cell on the day he died and the tiny exercise yard where he was allowed out.\nVladimir Putin, who studiously avoided naming Navalny while he was alive, briefly referred to him a month after his death by stating that a person passing was \"always a sad event\".\nThe Russian president also said he had agreed to a planned prisoner swap between Navalny and \"some people\" held in Western jails, on condition that Navalny did not come back to Russia. \"But such is life. There's nothing to be done about it,\" Putin said.\nIt is highly unlikely Moscow will issue any further comment on Navalny's death.\nHis popularity and internet savviness long rattled the Kremlin, while senior figures were irritated by his investigations into high-profile government corruption.\nWith Navalny's death Russia lost the last towering opposition figure who challenged Putin's rule.\nMany of his associates have been jailed or have fled Russia. Navalnaya herself faces arrest, and she and her two children live abroad.\nThe crackdown on civil society ramped up further following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and punitive new laws leading to mass arrests have muzzled any opposition. In both life and death Navalny managed to draw out huge crowds onto the streets. Thousands of mourners turned out for his funeral in Moscow in March 2024 despite well-founded fears of a police crackdown. No large opposition gatherings have taken place in Russia since."

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pj502ev6o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "Artificial intelligence can predict people's health problems over a decade into the future, say scientists.\nThe technology has learned to spot patterns in people's medical records to calculate their risk of more than 1,000 diseases.\nThe researchers say it is like a weather forecast that anticipates a 70% chance of rain – but for human health.\nTheir vision is to use the AI model to spot high-risk patients to prevent disease and to help hospitals understand demand in their area, years ahead of time.\nThe model – called Delphi-2M - uses similar technology to well-known AI chatbots like ChatGPT.\nAI chatbots are trained to understand patterns of language so they can predict the sequence of words in a sentence.\nDelphi-2M has been trained to find patterns in anonymous medical records so it can predict what comes next and when.\nIt doesn't predict exact dates, like a heart attack on October 1, but instead estimates the likelihood of 1,231 diseases.\n\"So, just like weather, where we could have a 70% chance of rain, we can do that for healthcare,\" Prof Ewan Birney, the interim executive director of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, told me.\n\"And we can do that not just for one disease, but all diseases at the same time - we've never been able to do that before. I'm excited,\" he said.\nThe AI model was initially developed using anonymous UK data - including hospital admissions, GP records and lifestyle habits such as smoking - collected from more than 400,000 people as part of the UK Biobank research project.\nThe model was then tested to see if its predictions stacked up using data from other Biobank participants, and then with 1.9 million people's medical records in Denmark.\n\"It's good, it's really good in Denmark,\" says Prof Birney.\n\"If our model says it's a one-in-10 risk for the next year, it really does seem like it turns out to be one in 10.\"\nThe model is best at predicting diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart attacks and sepsis that have a clear disease progression, rather than more random events like infections. People are already offered a cholesterol-lowering statin based on a calculation of their risk of a heart attack or stroke.\nThe AI tool is not ready for clinical use, but the plan is to use it in a similar way, to spot high-risk patients while there is an opportunity to intervene early and prevent disease. This could include medicines or specific lifestyle advice - such as people likely to develop some liver disorders benefitting from cutting back their alcohol intake more than the general population. The artificial intelligence could also help inform disease-screening programmes and analyse all the healthcare records in an area to anticipate demand - such as how many heart attacks a year there will be in Norwich in 2030, to help plan resources.\n\"This is the beginning of a new way to understand human health and disease progression,\" said Prof Moritz Gerstung, head of the division of AI in oncology at DKFZ, the German Cancer Research Centre.\nHe added: \"Generative models such as ours could one day help personalise care and anticipate healthcare needs at scale.\"\nThe AI model, described in the scientific journal Nature, needs refining and testing before it is used clinically. There are also potential biases as it was built from UK Biobank data which is drawn mostly from people aged 40 to 70, rather than the whole population. The model is now being upgraded to account for more medical data such as imaging, genetics and blood analysis.\nBut Prof Birney says: \"Just to stress, this is research – everything needs to be tested and well-regulated and thought about before it's used, but the technology is here to make these kinds of predictions.\"\nHe anticipates it will follow a similar path to the use of genomics in healthcare where it took a decade to go from scientists being confident in the technology to healthcare being able to use it routinely. The study was a collaboration between the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) and the University of Copenhagen.\nProf Gustavo Sudre, a neuroimaging and AI researcher at King's College London, commented: \"This research looks to be a significant step towards scalable, interpretable, and – most importantly – ethically responsible form of predictive modelling in medicine.\""

    "content": "Workers throughout the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) supply chain are being told to apply for universal credit following the cyber attack on the company, a union has said.\nUnite said staff were being laid off with \"reduced or zero pay\" following the hack, which has forced the carmaker to shut down its IT networks and halt production. Unite has called for the UK government to set up a furlough scheme, similar to the one announced by the Scottish government for bus maker Alexander Dennis.\nJLR declined to comment on the union's claim. It has previously said factory production would not resume until 24 September at the earliest, but sources claim disruption could last until November.\nUnite general secretary Sharon Graham said it was the \"government's responsibility to protect jobs and industries that are a vital part of the economy\".\n\"Workers in the JLR supply chain must not be made to pay the price for the cyber attack,\" she added.\nMinister for Industry Chris McDonald met representatives from JLR on Tuesday.\nIn a statement on Wednesday, he said he has had discussions with the firm about restarting production and will be meeting with others in the industry, and those that supply it, in the coming days to hear about the issues they are facing as a result of the cyber attack.\n\"We know this is a worrying time for those affected, and although Jaguar Land Rover are taking the lead on support for their own supply chain, our cyber experts are supporting them to resolve the issue as quickly as possible,\" he said.\nA spokesperson for Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Tuesday there were currently no discussions about offering taxpayer help to JLR amid the production pause.\nJLR's supply chain supports 104,000 jobs in the UK and sits at the top of a pyramid of suppliers, many of whom are highly dependent on the carmaker being their main customer. The hack, which occurred more than two weeks ago, has forced the manufacturer to shut down its computer systems and close production lines worldwide.\nThe crisis is thought to have cost JLR at least £50m a week. A criminal investigation is under way.\nThere are growing concerns that many of JLR's suppliers, small and medium-sized firms, do not have the resources to cope with an extended interruption to business and subsequent losses.\nJLR's three factories in Britain normally produce around 1,000 cars a day. It has told many of its 33,000 staff to stay at home.\nLiam Byrne MP, the chair of the Commons business and trade committee, said on Wednesday that the attack could see hundreds of supply chain staff laid off.\nByrne said he had written to the chancellor to request Covid-style emergency help for suppliers.\n\"This is not a mere flicker on the screen at Jaguar Land Rover, this is a digital siege and it's sent a cyber shockwave through their supply chain,\" he said.\n\"We think this is an attack which is much, much worse than the attack that took down Marks and Spencer.\"\nJLR has said it delayed restarting production as a \"forensic investigation\" of the cyber attack continued and it considered a \"controlled restart\" of global operations."

    "content": "Hats! Jewels! Dresses! Tiaras!\nState visits are as much about what everyone is wearing as they are about what they’re saying and doing.\nIt is an exercise in fashion diplomacy - and there has been plenty of it on display as US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania visit the UK.\nFrom the First Lady's hat, to the Princess of Wales's feather brooch, here are some of the most eye-catching looks so far.\nMelania is no stranger to impressive headwear - her white and navy wide-brimmed hat was a talking point at her husband's inauguration earlier this year. There was an awkward moment when Trump tried to kiss her and the brim of her hat made it a tricky task. Cue the internet blowing up.\nThe first lady has gone for a similarly dramatic flourish on day one of the state visit. She arrived at Windsor Castle wearing a wide-brimmed purple hat that seemed to obscure her eyes, which she paired with a timeless dark grey suit by Dior.\n\"Melania's hat is not by chance,\" said Marian Kwei, a celebrity stylist and Vogue contributor\n\"The hat with the wide brim that hides her face is pointing to a stance where she wants all eyes on her husband and his agenda while here,\" she added.\nShe noted that it matched the exact colour of Trump's tie, in \"a nod to her support for her husband's agenda during this state visit\".\nDior is a favourite fashion house for Melania, and, for Kwei, her decision to wear it is a nod to America's support for Europe.\nOn Tuesday, Melania stepped onto UK soil wearing the most British of fashion items: a Burberry trench coat.\nShe wore the honey-coloured, floor-length coat with the collar turned up, while flashes of its signature lining were visible underneath.\nMelania, 55, completed the look with black sunglasses and boots.\nVanessa Friedman, chief fashion critic at The New York Times, said that wearing a British-made coat could be an example of engaging in sartorial diplomacy, which is something many first ladies have done.\nFor the Trumps' last state visit in 2019, Melania – a former model – also dressed in her British best, opting for brands such as Burberry, although she added a mix of European fashion houses too (think Celine and Dolce & Gabbana), as well as American designers including Michael Kors.\nIt will be interesting to see how the choice of a British brand on this trip will be perceived back at home, says Kwei, given that Trump's message is about serving the interests of the United States before those of any other country.\nThe Queen, 78, was seen in a vibrant sapphire blue dress, a matching coat by Fiona Clare and hat by Philip Treacy.\nShe completed the look with a sapphire and diamond brooch.\nThe Princess of Wales, 43, wore a burgundy Emilia Wickstead dress and a matching hat by Jane Taylor.\nFrom both the Queen and the Princess, it's a strong showing for British designers.\nCatherine completed her look with a feather brooch.\nKwei noted it was interesting that, like the Trumps, the princess also chose to match her outfit to her husband, the Prince of Wales, 43, who wore a burgundy tie.\n\"As with Melania, this is to show support and that she's at one with her spouse and home country's agenda,\" she said.\n\"Blue and red!\", royal expert Victoria Murphy said of the outfit choices by the Queen and Catherine.\n\"This seems a clear example of coordinated diplomatic dressing to me, to reflect the US flag. It's an example of how the outfits can send a powerful diplomatic message.\""

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9zve281k3o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "Thousands have gathered in Parliament Square for a rally against US President Donald Trump's second state visit.\nOrganisers Stop Trump Coalition - a group of more than 50 unions and charities - marched from central London's Portland Place towards Whitehall at around 15:00 BST. Some protesters carried signs with slogans written across them including \"no to racism\", \"no to Trump\" and \"stop arming Israel\". Others carried smaller versions of the 20ft Trump Baby blimp that floated through crowds during protests against the president's first state visit in 2019.\nThe Metropolitan Police has estimated that up to 5,000 people are currently in attendance.\nMore than 1,600 police officers have been deployed including 500 from other forces, the force said. Earlier on Wednesday, the Met Police's Deputy Assistant Commissioner, Louise Puddefoot, said it would be \"another busy day\" for officers. This protest comes just days after the Unite the Kingdom protest.\nShe added that police had been in \"close contact\" with the organisers and had asked all taking part to be \"considerate to the local community\" and keep disruption to a minimum.\nThe Stop Trump Coalition includes groups ranging from climate campaigners to anti-racism groups and pro-Palestine organisations. Ahead of the march, a spokesperson for the coalition said: \"A government that will bow down to Trump and to racism is one that will open the door to fascism.\"\nAlthough Trump will not be visiting Parliament, the protest groups said they would demonstrate to \"defeat the politics of Trumpism\" and to promote \"an alternative, democratic vision of the world based on peace, social justice and international cooperation\".\nIn the midst of the crowds - which started gathering near BBC Broadcasting House - people told the BBC why they were there, racking up a long list of grievances against the US president. They said they found him \"despicable\" and wanted to send a message that he was not welcome.\nReverend Poppy Hughes, who was asked about those who said vicars should be apolitical, replied: \"Jesus preached peace and compassion and that's why I'm here\".\nZoe Gardner, a political commentator and one of the organisers of Wednesday's protest, said that Trump \"represents everything that we hate\".\n\"We want our government to show some backbone, and have a little bit of pride and represent that huge feeling of disgust at Donald Trump's politics in the UK,\" she added. Climate campaigner Auriel Dowty Glanville from Wimbledon said she was demonstrating because she believed the president was a \"climate denier\" and climate change was \"the biggest threat facing us on Earth\".\nShe called the second state visit invite \"appalling\", adding: \"It's all about the trade deal.\"\nSarah Montgomery and Claudio Solano, from North London, arrived in white protective face masks that read \"Trump stinks\".\nThey said they had had the masks since Trump's first state visit.\n\"He still stinks,\" Sarah says. \"Everything he stands for stinks.\"\nMr Solano, from Brazil, said he disagreed with both Trump's policies and his support for Brazil's former right-wing leader Jair Bolsonaro.\n\"It is disgusting, and I don't understand why Britain has to be so cowardly,\" he added. As the crowd moved, it paused outside Downing Street, which was being protected by officers from Wales and Northern Ireland. Some of the demonstrators carried signs including \"Duck Off Donald\" and \"Feed him to the Corgis\".\nAt Parliament Square - where the march stopped - a number of people took to a stage. There was a performance from singer Billy Bragg.\nOther speakers included former Labour MPs Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, comedian Nish Kumar, and Green Party leader Zack Polanski.\nA small crowd of protesters also gathered in Windsor on Wednesday afternoon, where Trump is spending the day with the Royal Family ahead of the state banquet.\nAmy Tisi told the BBC she protested the last time Trump visited and it was \"important to make a stand\". She said she questioned if the \"size and scale\" of the trip was meant to fuel his ego.\nBut one Trump supporter, wearing a Davy Crockett hat, called him \"the greatest president\". His remark was met with a chorus of boos from parts of the crowd.\nEarlier on Wednesday, a van decorated with a photograph of the president and late convicted paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein was driven through Berkshire.\nA Thames Valley Police spokesperson said the driver had left after a conversation with the police, adding: \"No arrests were made and no vehicles were seized.\"\nReferring to this incident during his speech in London, Corbyn called it \"sinister\" that the van was stopped by police, preventing people from \"expressing a point of view\".\n\"They take away the right to protest because they don't want us to protest,\" he added.\nFour men were arrested after images of Trump and Epstein were projected on to Windsor Castle on Tuesday as the president arrived in the UK.\nAdditional reporting by Alex Smith in Windsor"

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rynvlm6zjo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "US President Donald Trump is in the UK for an unprecedented second state visit. Trump and his wife Melania are staying with King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle, and will remain in the UK until Thursday night. The president was hosted by the late Queen Elizabeth II in June 2019.\nA state visit is a formal trip to the UK by the head of a country. They are usually arranged at the invitation of the monarch, acting on government advice.\nAs well as being grand occasions with lots of pageantry, the visits are used by governments to further Britain's interests.\nTraditionally, US presidents serving a second term - such as Trump - are not offered a state visit. Instead, they are invited for tea or lunch with the monarch, as happened with former presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush. However, in February Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer handed Trump an invitation from King Charles during a White House meeting to discuss a UK-US trade deal. Sir Keir said the invite was \"truly historic\" and \"unprecedented\".\nAt the time, Trump said it was a \"great, great honour\".\nTuesday\nWhen they landed at Stansted airport on Tuesday evening, the Trumps were met by US Ambassador Warren Stephens and Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper. The Viscount Hood, Lord-in-Waiting, welcomed them on behalf of the King.\nArriving in the UK, the president said: \"I have a lot of things here that warm my heart. I want to tell you. It's a very special place.\"\nThe couple spent the night at the US ambassador's residence, Winfield House, in central London. Wednesday\nTrump and the first lady flew to Windsor by helicopter, and were greeted by the Prince and Princess of Wales.\nThey were then formally welcomed by the King and Queen before joining them in a carriage procession through the Windsor estate. A royal salute was fired in Windsor and at the Tower of London, and the King invited Trump to inspect the guard of honour. After a private lunch with members of the Royal Family, the president visited St George's Chapel in Windsor and laid a wreath on the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II.\nThe planned joint flypast by UK and US F-35 military jets and the Red Arrows has been scaled back because of poor weather conditions. The Red Arrows are still expected to appear over Windsor.\nLater on Wednesday evening, a traditional state banquet will be held at the castle, during which both the King and president will deliver speeches.\nThursday The president will travel to the prime minister's country house Chequers, in Buckinghamshire, for a meeting with Sir Keir. They will view the Sir Winston Churchill archives before holding a meeting and a press conference. Melania Trump will remain at Windsor Castle where she will tour the Royal Library and see Queen Mary's Dolls' House, a famous miniature palace built in the 1920s. She will also meet Chief Scout Dwayne Fields with Catherine, who is joint president of the Scout Association.\nMrs Trump will then join her husband at Chequers before they return to the US.\nAccompanying Trump are US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, special envoy Steve Witkoff, chief of staff Susie Wiles and \"other senior White House staff\". Trump arrived in the UK on his customised, high-spec Boeing 747-200B aeroplane known as Air Force One.\nOnce on the ground, the president travels in Cadillac One - an enhanced limousine nicknamed \"The Beast\".\nTwo identical versions of the presidential limousine - as well as several other Secret Service vehicles - are flown over to the UK in military cargo planes in advance of Trump's arrival.\nWhile Trump will make some short journeys by limousine in the UK, he is expected to do most of his travelling by air - as was the case during his trip to Scotland in July. The president will have brought a fleet of helicopters with him including Marine One which, like Air Force One, is not a specific aircraft but instead refers to any US Marine Corps aircraft carrying the president.\nThe president's security has been tightened in recent days following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a university in Utah.\nPolice arrested four people on suspicion of projecting images of Donald Trump and the late disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on to the walls of Windsor Castle.\nThe footage appeared on Tuesday night as Trump touched down in the UK. There were some anti-Trump protesters among the crowds in Windsor on Wednesday. Thousands of people also gathered near the BBC's headquarters in London on Wednesday afternoon before marching towards Whitehall. Some carried banners reading: \"No to racism, no to Trump.\"\nOthers had smaller versions of the 20ft Trump baby blimp balloon which was carried through crowds during protests against the US president's first state visit in 2019.\nThe demonstration was organised by the Stop Trump UK coalition, a group of more than 50 campaign organisations, including climate, anti-racism and pro-Palestinian activists.\nIt previously called on the government to cancel the state visit, accusing the US president of \"denying climate science\" and \"siding with war criminals - in Israel, Russia and beyond\".\nThe group also organised protests in Aberdeen and Edinburgh during Trump's recent Scotland visit, involving hundreds of people in the two cities.\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said he would boycott the ceremonial banquet for Trump to \"send a message\" over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\nSince King Charles succeeded Queen Elizabeth in September 2022, he has hosted state visits from a number of international leaders and royals:\nHe and Queen Camilla have carried out state visits to France, Italy, Germany, Kenya and Samoa."

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7016ljre03o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "Major US tech firms have pledged tens of billions of pounds worth of investment in the UK, with Nvidia Jensen Huang, predicting the country will become an \"AI superpower\".\nThe biggest single investment comes from Microsoft, which has announced a $30bn (£22bn) spending package - its largest ever outside the US.\nIt is part of a £31bn agreement, dubbed the \"Tech Prosperity Deal\", between the UK government and several US tech giants as part of President Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK. \"This is the week that I declare the UK will be an AI superpower,\" Mr Huang told BBC News.\nHe said the UK had the expertise and research facilities to excel in AI, but \"what's missing is the AI infrastructure,\" adding: \"We are here to build it.\"\nAI relies on large banks of servers, run on computer chips like those made by Nvidia, to operate.\nNvidia is partnering with British infrastructure company Nscale to build more such data centres in the UK, and Mr Huang said he had aspirations of \"building an AI infrastructure company here in the UK, and then helping it scale out globally.\"\nMeanwhile, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said he expected AI investment to drive UK growth and productivity.\n\"It may happen faster, so our hope is not 10 years but maybe five,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Whenever anyone gets excited about AI, I want to see it ultimately in the economic growth and the GDP growth.\"\nThe deal will see Google, Nvidia and others invest in British-based infrastructure including data centres as well as the creation of a new supercomputer in Essex.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the deal would create highly skilled jobs \"putting more money in people's pockets and ensuring this partnership benefits every corner of the United Kingdom\".\nMr Nadella compared the economic benefits of the meteoric rise of AI with the impact of the personal computer when it became common in the workplace, about ten years after it first started scaling in the 1990s.\nBut there are also growing mutterings that AI is a very lucrative bubble that is about to burst. Mr Nadella conceded that \"all tech things are about booms and busts and bubbles\" and warned that AI should not be \"over-hyped or under-hyped\".\nHe acknowledged that its energy consumption remains \"very high\" but argued that its potential benefits, especially in the fields of healthcare, public services, and business productivity, were worthwhile. Meanwhile, when asked about the massive energy resources required to power AI, Mr Huang said solar power would contribute, and he was hoping for more gas turbines in the short term that could be put \"off the grid so we don't burden people on the grid\". He added that AI itself would design better gas turbines, solar panels, wind turbines and fusion energy to produce more cost-effective sustainable energy.\nThe campaign group Foxglove has warned that the UK could end up \"footing the bill for the colossal amounts of power the giants need\".\nThe supercomputer, to be built in Loughton, Essex, was already announced by the government in January, but Microsoft has now come on board to the project.\nMr Nadella was speaking exclusively to BBC News as Donald Trump arrived in the UK on a three-day state visit.\nThe Tech Prosperity Deal between the two countries seeks to strengthen ties on AI, quantum computing and nuclear power.\nQuestions have been asked about what if anything the UK has agreed to give in return.\nTechnology Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC the deal did not include guarantees over scrapping a tax for big tech or on copyright for AI companies.\nThe Digital Services Tax - a 2% levy which raises about £800m a year mainly from US tech companies - was previously said to be part of trade discussions.\nBut Ms Kendall told the Today programme \"that wasn't part of the partnership\" now agreed.\nShe also said no guarantees were made to AI companies on copyright, a major issue for the UK's creative sector - which has expressed concerns its work is being used by AI companies without permission.\nMeanwhile, a number of other tech companies have pledged billions of pounds in investment alongside Microsoft and Nvidia.\nGoogle has promised £5bn for AI research and infrastructure over the next two years.\nTech leaders including Nadella, Huang and OpenAI boss Sam Altman will accompany Trump to a state banquet hosted by the Royal Family at Windsor Castle on Wednesday evening.\nThe government also said there was \"potential for more than 5,000 jobs and billions in private investment\" in north-east England, which has been designated as a new \"AI growth zone\".\nIt has announced a data centre project at Cobalt Park, Northumberland - dubbed Stargate UK - from OpenAI, Nvidia, Nscale and semiconductor company Arm.\nHowever the UK version is much smaller than OpenAI's US-based Stargate project, launched in January with a commitment to invest $500bn (£367bn) over the next four years building new AI infrastructure.\nThe Tony Blair Institute described the news as a \"breakthrough moment\" but added Britain had some work to do.\nDr Keegan McBride, an emerging tech and geopolitics expert at the institute, said that work included \"reforming planning rules, accelerating the delivery of clean energy projects, and building the necessary digital infrastructure\" for growth.\nThe Conservative Party highlighted that other big international companies such as the pharmaceutical giant Merck have recently cancelled or delayed their UK expansion plans.\nAdditional reporting by Imran Rahman-Jones and Philippa Wain.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

    "content": "The Metropolitan Police says it is using an \"Al Capone\" approach to root out misconduct by its own officers.\nAs part of the biggest ever clear-out, the Met has removed more than 1,400 officers from the force from 2022 up to June 2025 for failing to meet standards. Deputy Commissioner Matt Jukes compared the approach to that of the American FBI who prosecuted Al Capone in the 1930s for tax evasion, rather than the murders he was suspected of. But Jukes insisted that failing officers will not get away with just being sacked.\n\"What we won't do in that process is neglect serious criminality or serious misconduct,\" he said. \"But rather than wait we'll put them out the door first, and we'll continue with those investigations, if that's the right thing to do.\"\n\"We're keen to exit those officers who don't display the standards required in the organisation, and we're going to do that in ways which are quick and focused,\" Jukes added.\nHe said sickness, grievances, overtime and the use of devices would be examined to identify officers of concern.\nSeparately, on Friday, the force said it had suspended eight officers and a staff member after allegations about staff in the custody suite at Charing Cross police station that arose from a BBC Panorama investigation.\nDetective Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan said he was in the process of \"dismantling\" the custody team at Charing Cross. He said all 16 custody sergeants and all 34 designated detention officers were being moved to other sites.\nDAC Adelekan said it was \"absolutely necessary to challenge the unacceptable culture we find in our custody environment\".\nA separate investigation of officers' behaviour in north-west London has led to a detective inspector being charged with perverting the course of justice.\n\"We are breaking up and busting up teams,\" Jukes said.\nThe clear-out, sparked in the wake of the murder of Sarah Everard by serving officer Wayne Couzens, is the largest in the force's history.\nSome 557 Met officers were \"exited\" last year alone - up from 146 in 2021.\nJukes said it was having \"as big an impact as the pursuit of corrupt officers in Sir Robert Marks' commissionership\".\nHe said the force now had \"one of the strongest ever vetting entry systems\"."

    "content": "Authorities across Egypt are searching for a 3,000-year-old bracelet reported missing from a leading museum in Cairo.\nThe rare gold band, adorned with spherical lapis lazuli beads, dates back to the reign of King Amenemope, a pharaoh of ancient Egypt's 21st Dynasty who ruled from 993 to 984BC.\nThe antiquities ministry said it had taken immediate measures after the bracelet disappeared from the Egyptian Museum's restoration laboratory, and that the case had been referred to police.\nAn image of the bracelet has been circulated to all Egyptian airports, seaports and land border crossings as a \"precautionary step to prevent smuggling attempts\", the ministry added.\nA specialist committee has also been formed to carry out an inventory and review of all artefacts being kept at the restoration laboratory.\nThe ministry said it had deliberately delayed announcing the bracelet's disappearance \"to ensure an appropriate environment for the progress of investigations\", but it did not mention when the piece of jewellery was last seen.\nEgyptian newspaper, Al-Misri al-Yawm, reported that the disappearance was detected in recent days as museum staff were preparing to ship dozens of artefacts to Rome for an exhibition which is due to open next month.\nThe Egyptian Museum in Cairo is the oldest archaeological museum in the Middle East. It houses more than 170,000 artefacts, including Amenemope's gilded wooden funerary mask.\nThe bracelet's disappearance comes six weeks before the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum in nearby Giza, where the world renowned treasures of King Tutankhamun's tomb have been transferred and will go on display."

    "content": "The European Commission has unveiled plans to restrict trade with Israel and impose sanctions on extremist ministers in its government, which - if adopted - would be the EU's toughest response to the war in Gaza.\nThe plans, trailed by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last week, would suspend trade-related provisions of the EU–Israel Association Agreement.\nThis would strip Israeli goods of privileged access to European markets, with tariffs imposed on billions of euros of exports - particularly agricultural produce like dates and citrus fruit.\nBut despite the forceful language, the measures appear unlikely to pass and have been dismissed by Israel as \"morally and politically distorted\".\nTrade restrictions require approval by a qualified majority of member states, while sanctions on individuals demand unanimity.\nBecause of the objection of key members, including Germany and Italy, and Ireland and Spain calling for far tougher action, adoption looks unlikely.\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas acknowledged the challenge in the European Council, telling reporters: \"Political lines are very much in the place where they have been so far.\"\nShe said the package also targeted \"Hamas terrorists\", unnamed \"extremist ministers\" in the Israeli government and \"violent settlers and entities supporting the impunity going on in the West Bank\".\nThe EU is Israel's number one trading partner, accounting for 32% of its trade in goods in 2024, worth €42.6bn (£35.8bn). Yet the economic impact of ending tariff preferences would be limited. Trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič estimated the effect at just €227m a year.\nThe only measure that takes immediate effect is the suspension of bilateral support to the Israeli government. But this too is largely symbolic with a mere €9.4m out of €14m allocated for 2020–24 – and does not require approval from member states.\nMediterranean Commissioner Dubravka Šuica stressed that funding for programmes tackling antisemitism and supporting civil society would not be affected.\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar dismissed the Commission's proposals as \"morally and politically distorted\", warning on X that actions against Israel would damage Europe's own interests and vowing that any steps taken against his country would be answered \"in kind.\"\nIt's not immediately clear when the measures will be voted on by members."

    "content": "Warning: Spoilers below for the ending of The Summer I Turned Pretty\nThe Summer I Turned Pretty, one of the most talked-about TV shows of the year, has reached its emotional finale after weeks of anticipation about how its love triangle storyline would end.\nThe show's third and final season centres on Isabel (better known as Belly) and her choice between ex-fiancé Jeremiah and his brother and love rival Conrad.\nMost viewers were on Team Conrad, with feelings running so high that Amazon and creator Jenny Han recently told fans to stop sending the cast members abuse online.\nThe final episode dropped on Wednesday, and began with Conrad surprising Belly by turning up in Paris on the eve of her 22nd birthday.\nSpoilers below.\nAfter a day with a few twists and turns in Belly's adopted French home, she gets back together with Conrad and he declares his love for her - but she tells him she doesn't know if his feelings are genuine.\nHe leaves, but she runs through the streets to chase Conrad - soundtracked by Taylor Swift's Out of the Woods - and professes her love on his train and says she chooses him.\n\"If there are infinite worlds, every version of me chooses you in every one of them,\" she declares.\n\"She chooses him!!\" wrote one fan on TikTok with a soundtrack of Abba's The Winner Takes It All.\n\"I am so happy,\" wrote another with four crying emojis. \"FINALLY FINALLY,\" said another.\nMeanwhile, back in Cousins, Massachusetts, Jeremiah ends up with Denise and reconciles with his dad.\n\"Happily ever after for everyone? It seems so!\" Deadline wrote.\nFan Glenta Ekhaguere, 20, is hosting a finale watch party in Manchester. She told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat she started watching the series during the pandemic – and is now addicted.\n\"It was - and is - a sense of comfort, especially with what's been going on in the world lately. You won't get shamed for it!\" she said.\nShe is hosting the party to raise money for charity – and to meet new people.\n\"I thought it would be a good way to fundraise and to create an event people would want to meet people at, with something they have in common. The Summer I Turned Pretty is something I really enjoyed – and I know a lot of people enjoy the show.\n\"My friend put me on to the series – I'm a similar age to Belly, so it's also a sense of relatability. Season three revolves around her finding herself, so in that sense I can relate to that... but I've never had two brothers fighting over me!\"\nPrime Video has said the season three premiere drew 25 million viewers in its first week, hit number one on the platform in 120 countries, and is its most-watched season among women ages 18-34, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nHan, who wrote the original books and co-wrote the final episode, told the paper she had enjoyed seeing people come together to watch the show \"like it's the Super Bowl\".\nShe has, however, cautioned fans against personal abuse on social media.\n\"People can forget that you're talking about a character, but you're saying things about the person that plays the character when you're talking about their appearance or mannerisms,\" she said.\n\"That is a real person, and just because they're famous doesn't mean that it's not painful to read those things.\"\nHan also put a message in the end credits of the finale thanking viewers and teasing a possible future spin-off.\n\"Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the love you've shown The Summer I Turned Pretty all these years,\" she wrote.\n\"Whether you've been with Belly since the very first book or joined us with the show I'm so grateful you've made Belly's story part of your summers.\n\"We put our hearts into this and we're so thankful to you for coming along with us for the ride. Maybe we'll meet again one summer in Cousins.\n\"Until then - all of my love always, Jenny.\"\nRadio Times said fans would lap up a follow-up, writing: \"While the ending was satisfying and closed the central question of the show, fans undoubtedly want to see happily-in-love Belly and Conrad – and what happens next not just for them, but for Jeremiah and his new flame, as well as Steven and Taylor.\"\nBBC News used AI to help write the summary at the top of this article.

    "content": "Sam Fenton is the first British quarterback to play for a Division One team in US collegiate football\nThis summer, 21-year-old Sam Fenton became the first British player to join a Division One college team in the United States as a quarterback.\nGiven he only began playing the sport seven years ago, his journey to the elite level of US college sport is remarkable.\nFenton got his first glimpse of American football watching a docuseries and confessed the sport \"didn't seem real\" to him.\nBut the Londoner was intrigued enough to take up a game that has now become the central part of his life as he pursues a professional career in America.\nIf leaving home was hard, the next challenge will be even tougher - carry on learning his craft, win a starting spot at the University of South Florida (USF) and impress enough in his time at college to be selected by an NFL team in the yearly draft.\n\"This is the hardest position in sports, that's what I believe,\" Fenton told BBC Sport.\n\"The pressure's what I love. If you win, you get all the glory. If you lose, everyone blames it on you because you're the main guy.\"\nFormer Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning won two Super Bowls and holds the record for most NFL Most Valuable Player awards, with five\nThe quarterback is the central player in an American football team. Almost every attacking play, with the exception of kicking and punting, goes through them. They are the creative heartbeat, with 17 of the past 20 Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards - given to the NFL player of the season - won by players in that role. And 14 of the past 20 winners of the Super Bowl MVP were the signal callers on the winning team.\nTwo-time Super Bowl winner Peyton Manning said quarterback was such a difficult role to perform because \"you have to know everyone else's job just as well as your own\".\nMud, sweat & touchdowns - UK's grassroots gridiron\nScouted in a furniture shop - UK's NFL hopefuls\n\"Win or lose, you are going to be front and centre. You have to give credit when it's good, you have to take the blame when it's bad,\" the five-time NFL MVP told the Netflix documentary Quarterback, external.\n\"When you finish high school and you finish college, you kind of say, 'OK, now no more homework'. And for a quarterback, the homework is just beginning. You have to know not just your assignment, [but] 10 other guys' assignments as well.\"\nFenton first realised his skills with the ball in hand doing long throws as a goalkeeper\nThis is something Fenton has already grown accustomed to at USF.\nPart of the roster for the South Florida Bulls, the freshman's schedule stretches from 5am to 10pm every day to accommodate training, classes and studying.\nThe very best college players will earn their opportunity to play at the top level in the NFL through the draft, but that is not yet a focus for Fenton as he is only beginning his journey at USF.\nHe said: \"You've got to love this game and you've got to put the hours behind when nobody's watching. When you're going over film, going over playbooks, to make sure that when you go on the field you don't have any missed assignments, everything is flowing through your brain and you're able to process the game at high speed.\"\nFenton, who is 6ft 6in (198cm) tall, grew up playing as a goalkeeper in the youth sides for the Metropolitan Police in Surrey, and playing tennis in Surbiton.\nA key facet of his football game had been throwing the ball out beyond the halfway line to launch quick counter-attacks for his team-mates, so moving across to playing quarterback was a natural fit.\nHe first began playing for Cobham Cougars in Surrey, before joining the NFL Academy, a UK-based programme set up by the NFL and designed to find and develop the finest talent in Europe and Africa.\nThe academy has had several alumni play for collegiate Division One teams, including 25 this season, but never before at quarterback.\nTom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers won Super Bowl LV at Raymond James Stadium in 2021\nCompetition for Fenton is fierce at South Florida, with starting quarterback Byrum Brown in his senior year, graduate Gaston Moore brought in from Tennessee this summer, while there is also fellow freshman Locklan Hewlett to compete with for the jersey.\nThe Bulls play at the Raymond James Stadium, which hosted Super Bowl LV - when Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat Patrick Mahomes' Kansas City Chiefs to win the Vince Lombardi Trophy at their home stadium four years ago.\nFenton hoped his opportunity to run out for the Bulls at the famous stadium will come soon, but he is focused on improving and learning each day.\n\"Right now, I'm just trying to keep my head down and develop as a player,\" he added.\n\"It's a massive step up for me to come over here and it's definitely been a steep learning curve to learn everything and absorb all that the coaches are saying.\n\"So to develop and get better and to have an elite process. I'll take each day as it comes and see what the future holds.\""

    "title": "Politicians get rich while we suffer - so I helped bring down our government in 48 hours",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg9n760gddo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "Nepal's Gen Z protesters brought down a government in under 48 hours – but the victory has come at a heavy price.\n\"We are proud, but there is also a mixed baggage of trauma, regret and anger,\" says Tanuja Pandey, one of the protest organisers.\nWith 72 people killed, last week's protests were the deadliest unrest in the Himalayan country in decades. Official buildings, residences of political leaders and luxury hotels such as the Hilton, which opened in July 2024, were torched, vandalised and looted. The wife of a former prime minister is fighting for her life after their home was set ablaze.\nThe protests represented \"a wholesale rejection of Nepal's current political class for decades of poor governance and exploitation of state resources\", said Ashish Pradhan, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group. But the damage to government services, he added, could \"parallel the toll of the 2015 earthquake which took almost 9,000 lives\". The destruction is not only confined to the capital Kathmandu - at least 300 local government offices across the nation have been damaged.\nThe financial losses could amount to 3 trillion Nepalese rupees ($21.3bn; £15.6bn), nearly half of the country's GDP, according to the Kathmandu Post. Its offices were also attacked by crowds and set on fire.\nTwo days before the deadly demonstration on 8 September, Ms Pandey, a 24-year-old environmental campaigner, uploaded a video showing a mining site in Chure, one of the most fragile mountain ranges in the region. Nepal's resources should belong to the people, not to \"politicians' private limited companies\", she wrote, calling on her peers to \"march against corruption and the misuse of our nation's wealth\".\nLike many youth movements in Asia, Nepal's Gen Z protests were leaderless. Others had made similar pleas to Ms Pandey's after the Nepali government decided to ban 26 social media platforms, citing their failure to register locally.\nFor months, fury had been brewing against \"nepo babies\", the children of powerful politicians of all stripes, who were accused of flaunting their unexplained wealth on social media.\nOne of the most viral photos showed Saugat Thapa, the son of a provincial minister, standing next to a Christmas tree made of boxes of luxury brands including Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Cartier. In response, he said it was \"an unfair misinterpretation\" and his father \"returned every rupee earned from public service to the community\".\nMs Pandey had watched almost all \"nepo babies\" content, but one video juxtaposing the luxurious life of a political family and an ordinary young Nepali who had to find work in a Gulf country struck her.\n\"It is painful to watch, especially knowing that even educated youth are forced to leave the country because wages here are far below what one needs to live with dignity,\" she said.\nNepal is a young democracy. It became a republic in 2008, after a decade-long, Maoist-led civil war that killed more than 17,000 people.\nBut the promised stability and prosperity have not materialised. In 17 years, Nepal has had 14 governments, and no leader has completed a full five-year term. The country's politics resemble a game of musical chairs, with communist parties and the centrist Nepali Congress taking turns to rule. Three leaders, including KP Sharma Oli who resigned over the Gen Z protests, returned to power multiple times.\nNepal's GDP per capita remained under $1,500, making it the second-poorest country in South Asia, behind only Afghanistan. An estimated 14% of the population work overseas, and one in three households receives remittances.\nMs Pandey comes from a middle-class family in eastern Nepal and her father is a retired government teacher. Three years ago, she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, for which she is still receiving treatment. The medical bills nearly bankrupted her family, so her older sister moved to Australia to support them.\nBefore the protests, Ms Pandey worked with others to create guidelines stressing non-violence and respect and reminding participants to stay vigilant against \"hijackers\".\nOn the morning of 8 September, she arrived at Maitighar Mandala, a huge traffic island in central Kathmandu with several of her friends. She was expecting thousands would turn up at most – but the crowds kept swelling.\nAakriti Ghimire, a 26-year-old protester, said things were initially peaceful and communal. \"We were all seated, we were singing old Nepali songs,\" she said. \"The slogans and everything were so funny, we were enjoying it. And after that, we started to march… the police were there to ensure that there were no vehicles disturbing us.\"\nBoth Ms Pandey and Ms Ghimire started to sense danger at around midday, when crowds began moving to New Baneshwor, the neighbourhood housing parliament. Both saw people arriving on motorbikes, and Ms Pandey said these people appeared older than average Gen Z protesters.\nMs Ghimire believes they were infiltrators. \"It became very tricky for us to distinguish the peaceful protesters – some people who genuinely came for something – versus those who came in with the intention of being violent.\"\nWhen some protesters tried to breach the security around parliament, police fired tear gas, water cannon and shots in return. There is evidence live rounds were used and they are accused of shooting at schoolchildren as well. An investigation into what happened is under way.\nChaos and violence reigned the next day. Demonstrators retaliated by setting parliament, the prime minister's office and other government buildings ablaze. Both Ms Pandey and Ms Ghimire stayed indoors and watched the developments online.\n\"A lot of people did share that it felt so good to finally see politicians face the consequences of everything they've done,\" Ms Ghimire said, referring to the destruction of the leaders' homes. But the mood soon darkened.\n\"I saw people with bottles filled with petroleum. They got it from the motorbikes. They started attacking the parliament,\" said Ms Pandey.\nThe law graduate cried after seeing the Supreme Court on fire, saying that it was like \"a temple\" for her. Her friends at the scene were pouring water on the flames to try to put them out. They all knew the effort would be futile – they did it only to console themselves.\n\"People say the arsonists intended to come and burn these things… Who are these people?\" asked Ms Ghimire. \"The videos show these people are all masked.\"\nSome calm was restored when the army was deployed to take control of the situation - a curfew was in place for days. Later in the week former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki was appointed interim prime minister. She had been backed by protesters for the post. Ms Pandey hopes she \"can lead the country efficiently, do the election in stipulated time and hand the power to the people\".\nBut the anxiety about Nepal's political future persists.\nRumela Sen, a South Asia expert at Columbia University, said it was \"worrying\" to see \"an unprecedented glorification of the army as a voice of sanity and stability\".\nMany are also uncomfortable with the involvement of Durga Prasai in the initial negotiation at the invitation of the military. Mr Prasai was arrested for his role in violent pro-monarchy protests in March. He fled to India but was returned to Nepal. The Gen Z protesters walked out of the talks over his involvement.\nMeanwhile, families of protesters who were killed are reckoning with their deaths.\n\"We are deeply shocked because we have lost our beloved son,\" said Yubaraj Neupane, whose 23-year-old son Yogendra died in the protests. \"I am yet to find out how he died.\" Yogendra was shot in the back of the head near the parliament building, according to the post mortem report.\nFrom south-eastern Nepal, the family's eldest son had pursued his studies in Kathmandu and aspired to be a civil servant. He was always studying, friends and relatives said.\nBut on 8 September, he joined the protests with his friends, dreaming of bringing change to the country. His family didn't know he was at the scene until he called them after the situation started heating up.\n\"Our beloved has lost his life calling for change,\" his great-uncle Saubhagya said. \"His blood and sacrifice should be recognised so that other young people won't have to hit the streets again in the future.\"\nMs Pandey said she was cautiously optimistic about her country's future, but the trauma of the past week would stay with her for the rest of her life.\nThis is a political awakening for her generation. \"We are no longer willing to stay silent or accept injustice,\" she says. \"This is not just a gentle nudge; it's a bold challenge to a system that has hoarded power for decades.\"\nAdditional reporting by Grace Tsoi"

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9n0y34z14o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "When Alan gave his Persian tabby cat, Smokey, its regular flea treatment last year, he thought nothing could go wrong.\nThe 45-year-old from Preston had used the same brand - Frontline Plus - for years without any trouble. But within hours of applying a new dose he'd bought online, his usually lively tabby was violently ill, vomiting and refusing food or water.\n\"I bought it from a major online site and the price seemed similar so I didn't suspect anything at the time,\" Alan told the BBC's Morning Live. Alan's story comes after the government recently issued an urgent warning about fake veterinary products being sold online.\nWith vet bills up 60% in the last decade, more owners are turning to the internet to hunt for bargains.\nThe vet that Alan took Smokey to initially found nothing abnormal, but when his condition deteriorated, scans revealed a blockage in his intestines. Emergency surgery saved his life - at a cost of £3,000 - and tests later confirmed he had suffered a toxic reaction.\nAlan returned to the vet with the packaging. At first glance, it looked genuine, labelled as \"Gatti\" - which Alan assumed might be an Italian version of the medication. But when the manufacturer was contacted, they confirmed it was counterfeit and laboratory testing found it contained a chemical highly toxic to cats.\n\"We felt really guilty about the fact we had done this to him,\" Alan said. \"But finding out it was fake medication, we were really angry.\n\"It's horrific and I had absolutely no idea there was such a thing as fake pet medication.\" Helen Barnham works at the Intellectual Property Office (IPO), a government team tasked with trying to stop the sale of counterfeit goods.\nThe team has issued more than 100 seizure notices for the selling of unauthorised animal medicines and supplements, preventing around 18,000 illegal items from reaching consumers.\n\"Criminals copy these products to make them look like the original and it's all to make money, they don't care about the damage or harm,\" she explained. According to the IPO, the online seller who Alan bought the medication from managed to sell 211 batches of suspected counterfeit pet medications and supplements.\n\"If it's not from a vet or a trusted seller then please be vigilant,\" Barnham said. Barnham is urging pet owners to check all pet medicines carefully before using them. Even if a product looks authentic, there are often subtle clues something is wrong.\nNina Downing, Vet Nurse from PDSA, a vet charity, says she always recommends only giving your pet medicine which has been prescribed by a vet. \"When fulfilling a prescription online, source them from reputable companies that are on the Register of online retailers, brought to you by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate.\"\nIf the medication has any of the above warning signs, you should stop using the product immediately and contact your vet for medical advice.\nYou should also report it to your local trading standards office and notify the brand manufacturer, who may be able to verify if it's genuine."

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cderznjj4r7o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "Food price inflation rose for the fifth month in a row in August with costs rising at the fastest pace since the beginning of last year, official figures show.\nThe cost of food and non-alcoholic drinks grew at an annual rate of 5.1% as beef, butter, milk and chocolate prices continued to surge.\nHowever, despite the increase in food costs, price growth in other areas such as air fares slowed, leaving the overall rate of UK inflation at 3.8% - the same as July. Economists said food bills have been rising because supermarkets were passing on government increases in the minimum wage and National Insurance Contributions (NIC) to shoppers through higher prices.\nOverall inflation remains above the Bank of England's 2% target and expectations are growing that its rate-setting committee will hold interest rates on Thursday.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves, who will set out the government's tax and spending plans in the Budget on 26 November, said that she knew \"families are finding it tough and that for many the economy feels stuck\".\nShe added: \"That's why I'm determined to bring costs down and support people who are facing higher bills.\"\nIn her first Budget last year, Reeves announced an increase in National Insurance Contributions for employers as well as a rise in the minimum wage.\nThe decision led to a backlash from many businesses, who argued it would lead to higher prices for customers. Reeves previously told firms after she would not be \"coming back with more borrowing or more taxes\", but speculation is growing over what taxes the chancellor will hike.\nShadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said price growth was \"deeply worrying for families\" and said Labour's tax policies are \"stoking inflation\". The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which publishes the figures, said the 5.1% increase in food and drink prices is the highest rate for 19 months.\nIt also said that inflation in the UK was \"significantly higher\" than the estimates for large European economies such as France and Germany.\nIn August, France's inflation was 0.8% while Germany recorded price growth of 2.1%.\nYael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said Britain had become \"an outlier in recent months on inflation compared to other major economies\".\nShe said: \"Since April, the rise in inflation has been driven largely by domestic policy choices, including the increase in employers' National Insurance Contributions. \"These higher costs have been passed on by businesses to consumers, feeding through into higher headline inflation.\"\nSome food items have continued to see particularly big increases. In the year to August, beef and veal prices were up nearly 25%, while butter prices grew by nearly 19% and chocolate rose by 15.4%.\nThe British Retail Consortium (BRC) said that food costs were outstripping average wage growth, which the ONS said reached 4.7% between May and July. \"With food inflation now outpacing wages, many families will be struggling with the rising cost of living,\" Kris Hamer, director of insight at the BRC, said.\nHowever, the prices of some goods such as clothing and footwear eased, which the BRC said was \"driven in part by retailers discounting the last of their summer collections\".\nIt added: \"Key staples such as cereals and pasta fell in price on the month.\"\nJames Smith, developed market economist at investment bank ING, said the inflation figure was \"certainly not good news for the Bank of England\".\nHe told the BBC that it remaining at 3.8% \"means the prospect for further interest rate cuts this year very much hang in the balance\".\n\"In terms of where we go from here, food inflation could climb a little bit higher into the end of the year,\" he added.\nThe Bank of England has cut interest rates five times since August last year, taking borrowing costs to 4%.\nIt has said it expects inflation to peak at 4% in September.\nThe central bank is widely expected to hold interest rates on Thursday. It then has two further rate-setting meetings this year - in November and December.\nEven with a projected rise in inflation, Capital Economics said it doubts the Bank will cut rates in November.\nBut Paul Dales, its chief UK economist, said: \"We still expect the looser labour market to weaken wage growth and eventually bring down UK inflation to similar rates as in the US and the eurozone, which will allow the Bank of England to cut rates from 4% now to 3% by the end of next year.\"\nButter and chocolate prices have directly affected Tom Egan, who co-founded and runs Coosh Bakery in Mapperley, Nottingham with his wife Rachel.\nHe said adverse weather conditions in cocoa-growing countries such as Ghana had \"more than doubled the price we get from our suppliers\".\n\"I think previously we were paying somewhere in the region of £60 for 10kg,\" he said. \"I think it has now gone up to over £150 for that same 10kg.\"\nButter prices have risen by 50% over the year, with suppliers telling Mr Egan that \"the actual quantity of milk that is being imported into the UK has gone down so obviously supply and demand has meant the price has surged on things like butter\".\nMeanwhile, he said the rise in National Insurance Contributions had \"stung a little bit\", leading to the bakery being more cautious about investment in areas such as equipment and technology, which could improve productivity.\nAdditional reporting by Haider Saleem"

    "content": "Four of Scotland's most high profile gangland figures have been arrested in Dubai.\nBBC Scotland News understands that Steven Lyons, Ross McGill, Stephen Jamieson and Steven Larwood were taken into custody on Tuesday.\nPolice Scotland believe all four are linked to criminality ranging from drug importation to a feud between rival criminal gangs in Glasgow and Edinburgh.\nThe dispute has resulted in a series of assaults, shootings and firebombings since March.\nIt is understood detectives have been sharing intelligence with police in the United Arab Emirates, where the men are all based.\nIt is unclear if officers in Scotland were made aware of the Dubai raids in advance.\nAnd it remains to be seen whether the authorities will press charges or whether moves will be made to extradite the men - who may be deemed a flight risk - back to Scotland.\nDetectives working on Operation Portaledge, which was set up in response to the gang violence, have so far made 57 arrests.\nSources have told BBC Scotland News the significance of the Dubai arrests cannot be underestimated.\nOne said: \"All four are operating at the highest level of organised crime, both at a UK and an international level.\"\nSteven Lyons is the head of the Lyons crime group, which has been involved in a bloody feud with the rival Daniel clan for more than 20 years.\nIn 2006 he survived a shooting at a garage in Lambhill, in the north of Glasgow, which claimed the life of his cousin, Michael Lyons.\nHe later moved to Spain before settling in Dubai.\nIn May, Steven Lyons' brother, Eddie Lyons Jnr, and Ross Monaghan were shot dead in a beachfront bar in Fuengirola on the Costa del Sol.\nBoth men had spent the evening watching the Champions League final before they were targeted by a lone gunman.\nMichael Riley, 44, from Liverpool, has been accused by Spanish police of the murders with a full extradition hearing scheduled for later this year.\nIn the days after the double shooting a Spanish National Police detective said the suspect was a member of the rival Glasgow-based Daniel gang.\nBut Police Scotland have maintained there is nothing to suggest the murders in Spain are linked to the ongoing gang war or that it was planned in Scotland.\nMcGill first became known to police for his activities while a senior member of Rangers ultras group, the Union Bears.\nBut since March he has emerged as a key figure in the gangland feud which has been responsible for a wave of violence in the east and west of the country.\nBBC Scotland News understands it was triggered by a fall out between McGill and Edinburgh drug dealer Mark Richardson, who is currently in prison.\nLarwood is a known associate of Lyons and previously lived in Spain before relocating to Dubai.\nJamieson, who has lived in the desert city for a number of years, has links to Jamie \"Iceman\" Stevenson, who was last year jailed for orchestrating a plot to smuggle cocaine worth £100m from South America in boxes of bananas. Police Scotland said it was unable to confirm the arrests.\nIt is understood the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office has not been approached for consular assistance.\nDubai Police referred BBC Scotland News to the UK Embassy in Dubai but it has yet to comment."

    "content": "Heavy rain is set to drench much of the UK over the next few days with the possibility for flooding and travel delays in the hardest-hit locations.\nThe Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for rain across parts of south Wales lasting through 23:00 BST on Wednesday. A total of 30-40mm is forecast to fall widely, with up to 70mm in some locations.\nIt comes as a slow-moving weather front is forecast to stall across parts of Wales and northern England, bringing persistent outbreaks of rain. The rain will become increasingly heavy through the weekend as a new area of low pressure develops.\nThere may be some areas of localised flooding and tricky driving conditions especially as the rain turns heavier. Over the hills some areas could see as much as 100-150mm of rain. Northern Ireland is close to this front so the weather could be quite wet in the far southeast , otherwise it probably won't be as wet as it has been over the last week or two.\nWet and windy weather in Scotland will clear to more showery conditions. It will turn colder here, perhaps even cold enough for some wintriness over the very tops of the Scottish mountains by the weekend.\nIn south-east England, the Midlands and East Anglia it will become much warmer over the next few days with temperatures set to soar up to 26C in some areas on Friday. Outbreaks of rain and cooler air will arrive over the weekend.\nAlready parts of the UK have received almost double their average September rainfall thanks to persistent south-westerly winds which have been responsible for bringing in a succession of areas of low pressure from the Atlantic. It is these areas of the country, most exposed to these winds, which have seen the largest amounts of rain. Cardiff has seen more rainfall in September than the whole of summer.\nBut it is not just areas of Wales that has had a very wet start to the month, Northern Ireland, northwest and southern England have also been drenched.\nIt's been very wet so far this month in parts of the south and west\nA change to much drier weather is on the way for the last week of September\nHigh pressure is expected to return to the UK next week and will bring a much more settled spell of weather with some sunshine.

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/articles/clylxn88xymo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "Wightman takes silver in men's 1500m\nJake Wightman said his world 1500m silver medal felt like gold after making his return to a global podium, but British team-mate Josh Kerr's title defence was ruined by a calf injury in a dramatic final in Tokyo. Wightman, the 2022 world champion, achieved redemption having struggled with injuries and missed the past two major championships.\nThe 31-year-old collapsed with exhaustion after crossing the line before staring up at the big screen, which revealed Portugal's Isaac Nader had pipped him to gold by two hundredths of a second in a thrilling finish.\nAlthough he came up agonisingly short, it is a second place which he said felt as good as first after the challenges of recent years - and Britain's long-awaited first medal of the championships.\n\"It will take a while to process this. I'm a big believer that you get what you put in at some point. I'm just very, very happy that all the persistence has been well worth it,\" Wightman told BBC Sport.\n\"I felt like I had another gear through the rounds. All I'd said was that I would hit the front at some point. I did not know what would happen and I nearly got there.\n\"For me this is a gold. Just getting on the start line at a championship final is a gold.\n\"I went into it with a bit of freedom that whatever would happen, happens.\"\n'It's been a bleak couple of years, this is like a gold to me' - Wightman on 1500m silver\nHowever, there was heartbreak for Kerr, seeking to become only the fourth man to retain the 1500m title but denied the opportunity after pulling up in pain on the penultimate lap.\nHaving positioned himself at the back of the race from the start, he eventually managed to hobble over the line and finished last. Neil Gourley was 10th.\nGreat Britain have had to wait until the fifth day of competition to celebrate success in Japan, where they were set a target of eight medals following a record-equalling haul of 10 in 2023.\nBut Wightman's stunning silver lifted them to 17th in the medal table.\nFormer Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford said on BBC TV: \"Everybody suffers with injuries in their careers. Jake Wightman shows that you can come back from it and the good guys do still win medals.\n\"For anybody young watching this, suffering with something difficult, it shows that you can push through.\"\nCalf injury hinders Kerr in world title defence\nWorld Athletics medal table - and what's on Thursday?\nWorld Athletics: Recap as Wightman wins silver and Kerr injured in 1500m final\nWightman has endured a long road to return to the position of fighting for the sport's biggest prizes, since his crowning moment three years ago.\nBut he has always maintained his belief that he would get there. Wightman was accepting that the injury which kept him out of Budapest two years ago was a consequence of the demands of winning world, European and Commonwealth medals in an intense 33-day period in 2022.\nBut his hopes of returning to the global stage at last summer's Olympics were cruelly ended by a hamstring tear just one week out.\nBy that point, he had already been wearing the team's kit at their final training camp in St Moritz.\nGeoff Wightman reacts to son Jake winning World Athletics Championships silver\nWightman sought a refresh this year, making the difficult decision to end his coaching partnership with father Geoff, who was commentating inside the stadium when his son outlasted Jakob Ingebrigtsen to win gold in Eugene.\nIn what has been a year of significant change away from the track, Wightman began working with his partner Georgie's father, John Hartigan, and relocated to Manchester to be closer to his physiotherapist.\nThe only major change in terms of his training, Wightman says, has been to respect his body more.\n\"Honestly, it has been a very, very bleak couple of years for me. A lot of times I doubted if could make it back to this level,\" Wightman said.\n\"I have made some huge changes in my life this year. I want to thank my coaching team and my dad for getting me to this point in the first place. He did all the hard work bringing me to this level.\"\nHe added: \"When you get that close you cannot help but think 'what if I had tried a bit more?' But I left everything out there.\"\nOnce again commentating at the stadium where his son celebrated his medal, his father Geoff told BBC Sport: \"Jake could not have given any more there, it was pretty much a perfect race from him. I'm very proud.\n\"He dipped, which he does not usually do. I have given him a hard time for that sometimes. I hope I have contributed to that as well.\n\"[His mum] Susan and I are just very proud and we are enjoying the moment with him. I will be calling his medal ceremony tomorrow, so I will need to have a stiff upper lip for that.\"\n'There was something amiss' Cram and Radcliffe anlayse what went wrong for Kerr\nAfter a slow start to the championships, Great Britain's medal hopes were dented by an early 400m exit for the out-of-sorts Matthew Hudson-Smith on Tuesday.\nGB missed out on a mixed 4x400m relay medal on the opening night, Emile Cairess succumbed to the searing heat in the men's marathon and Molly Caudery suffered an unfortunate injury in pole vault qualification.\nBut, after becoming the 35th nation to win a medal in Tokyo, the team will be optimistic of producing a strong finish to these championships.\nOn Wednesday night, Dina Asher-Smith, Daryll Neita and Amy Hunt reached the semi-finals of the women's 200m competition, which is missing Gabby Thomas and Julien Alfred\nZharnel Hughes advanced in the men's event, as did defending champion Noah Lyles and Australia's exciting 17-year-old talent Gout Gout.\nOn Thursday, Olympic champion Keely Hodgkinson begins her bid for a first world 800m title and is joined in that event by training partner and Olympic 1500m bronze medallist Georgia Hunter Bell.\nAmber Anning will race for a women's 400m gold, while Max Burgin aims for a place in the 800m final and the 200m semi-finals also take place.\nGreat Britain are 17th in the table after winning a first medal on Wednesday"

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cewn0kd7l54o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "Phil Salt scored 89 for England in his first outing since an unbeaten 141 against South Africa last week\nFirst T20, Malahide\nIreland 196-3 (20 overs): Tector 61* (36), Tucker 55 (36)\nEngland 197-6 (17.4 overs): Salt 89 (46)\nEngland won by four wickets and lead series 1-0 Scorecard\nPhil Salt again starred for England as they beat Ireland by four wickets in the first match of a three-game T20 series in Dublin.\nThe England opener smashed 89 off 46 deliveries but came up short of what would have been his second consecutive century when he was caught by Ross Adair with the final delivery of the 15th over.\nBy then, however, Salt had broken the back of the chase for England, who finished the job of chasing Ireland's 196-3 with more than two overs to spare.\nTravelling without their all-format stars, England were captained by Jacob Bethell for the first time, with the 21-year-old hitting 24 off 16 balls before a tame swipe to extra cover just as he appeared to be going through the gears.\nIn what was their first international of any kind since a T20 win over West Indies on 15 June, Ireland will have felt their tally, which included half-centuries for both Harry Tector and Lorcan Tucker, was a competitive one.\nBut just five days after their stunning 304-2 against South Africa on a record-breaking night in Manchester, a much-changed England began their reply in emphatic fashion before Ireland battled back for some late wickets.\nThe win represented England's first victory over Ireland in the format in what was their second completed game, and the two sides will meet again at Malahide on Friday and Sunday. Salt-inspired England thrash Ireland in opening T20 - reaction\nOn the day when Bethell became the youngest player to captain an English team, his first act as Harry Brook's stand-in skipper was to win the toss and put the hosts in to bat.\nWith all the pre-match talk about the amount of cricket, or lack thereof, played by Ireland in the build-up to this series, there will have been plenty of interest in how openers Paul Stirling and Ross Adair fared.\nWhile there were certainly a few instances when the pair appeared to be searching for their rhythm in the early overs, Ireland were 49-0 at the end of the powerplay, with Stirling in particular providing some big hitting.\nOf the skipper's quartet of sixes, two were driven onto the roof of the hospitality tent at the compact ground in north Dublin.\nAfter providing the solid start, the opening pair fell in quick succession with Adair caught on the boundary by Phil Salt in the eighth over when attempting a sweep over the leg side off the bowling of Liam Dawson. Nine deliveries and 10 runs later, Stirling followed after swiping at the bowling of Adil Rashid with Will Jacks taking the catch.\nThe arrivals of Harry Tector and then Lorcan Tucker to the crease saw Ireland run an increased number of singles for the remainder of their innings but Tector still added seven boundaries in his unbeaten 61 from 36 balls. Tector, who brought up his own half-century with a drive for six, almost lasted to the end of the innings, only to edge the penultimate delivery into the gloves of Jos Buttler.\nHarry Tector became the fourth man to score 1,500 T20 runs for Ireland\nWithout the services of Mark Adair and Josh Little in their attack, it was the left-arm spin of Matthew Humphreys who opened the Irish bowling against Phil Salt in the visiting opener's first innings since reaching a century off just 39 balls against South Africa at Old Trafford last week.\nEngland quickly set about chasing down their target of 197. After Barry McCarthy and Graham Hume could find no answer for England's big-hitting, Craig Young slightly slowed their rapid progress in the fourth over, before Humphreys' return saw Buttler sky one to Curtis Campher to fall for 28 off 10 balls. Despite the loss of their first wicket, England still ended the powerplay on 84-1 with Salt's half-century coming off just 20 deliveries. He would survive being caught off a Tector no-ball but continued to knock Ireland's bowlers to all corners of the ground. Bethell's dismissal came after striking a six over the temporary stand before Gareth Delany marked his 100th Irish cap with the wicket off Rehan Ahmed. Even after Hume took the wickets of Sam Curran and Salt in the 15th over, England always looked on course for victory with Jamie Overton ultimately providing the winning runs with 20 deliveries to spare.\nEngland batter Phil Salt: \"I thought Ireland played well to get where they got. It was all about being confident and making that partnership with Jos to get off on the right foot.\"\nOn missing out on the century: \"I was annoyed to get out but not too annoyed about that to be honest. Coming away from home to a new ground and new conditions. Just getting the job done in the first one, I'm happy enough about that. I was slightly annoyed about the way I got out but looking back, it might have been quite greedy.\"\nEngland captain Jacob Bethell: \"It feels pretty special. Winning the first one is always nice.\n\"A great feeling and can't waiting to go again on Friday.\"\nIreland captain Paul Stirling: \"We'll take all the positives we can out of it. I was happy to go out there and get going. Hopefully throughout this series we can improve in all areas. We couldn't have asked for much more from our batters. To score 196 in the end was great.\""

    "content": "Manchester United's men's team are not competing in Europe this season\nManchester United earned record financial revenue of £666.5m last year despite the poor on-pitch performance of their men's team.\nUnited finished 15th in the Premier League last season, their worst placing since the 1973-74 relegation campaign.\nHowever, the start of their five-year front-of-shirt sponsorship deal with Snapdragon enabled them to post record commercial revenue of £333.3m, while matchday revenue was also a record at £160.3m in the year to 30 June 2025.\n\"To have generated record revenues during such a challenging year for the club demonstrates the resilience which is a hallmark of Manchester United,\" said chief executive Omar Berrada.\n\"As we settle into the 2025-26 season, we are working hard to improve the club in all areas.\"\nBerrada did not reference United's poor start to the current campaign but says United are building \"for the long term\".\nAn overall loss of £33m represents a 70.8% reduction on the previous year, when the figure was £113.2m.\nUnited say they \"remain committed to, and in compliance with, both the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules and Uefa's's Financial Fair Play Regulations\".\nIn January Deloitte ranked United as having the fourth highest revenue in world football, based on the club's earnings of £651m from the previous year. Real Madrid (£883m) were in first place, followed by Manchester City (£708m) and Paris St-Germain (£681m).\nThe overall number of employees has dropped from 1,100 to 700 in the past two years following controversial redundancies at United.\nCutting so many long-serving members of staff at a time of chronic under-performance on the pitch has been heavily criticised by many. United believe it will help provide the financial capacity to invest in the playing squad while remaining compliant with the Premier League and Uefa financial rules.\nWages were cut by £51.5m to £313.2m, although most of this related to United failing to qualify for the Champions League, which triggered a 25% salary cut among the playing staff.\nThe figures also contain an 'exceptional items' expense of £36.6m, which includes compensation payments to former manager Erik ten Hag, interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy and technical director Dan Ashworth.\nDespite their relative lack of success, United are still predicting turnover of between £640m and £660m to June 2026.\nThe Snapdragon deal has helped them leapfrog back above Liverpool in terms of commercial revenue.\n\"As we start to feel the benefits of our cost reduction programme, there is significant potential for improved financial performance, which will, in turn, support our overriding priority: success on the pitch,\" said Berrada.\nThe figures show a £48.9m reduction in broadcasting revenue - the consequence of playing in the Europa League last season as opposed to the Champions League. This season United are not in Europe at all. As ever, United's debt levels remain a talking point.\nThe long-term debt, which has effectively sat on the club since the Glazers bought it in 2005, remains at $650m, with the exchange rate on 30 June meaning it was £471.9m.\nIn addition, borrowings from the club's rolling credit facility had risen to £165.1m from £35.6m by 30 June.\nOn top of that, there is the amount owed in outstanding transfer fees.\nUnited are not alone in paying fees in installments over a period of time and the precise amounts they have to pay and when are unclear.\nHowever, they will form a significant part of the two 'trade and other payable' entries in the accounts released today that total £564.6m, up from £424.9m 12 months earlier.\nSince 30 June, United have bought Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig and Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp for fees club sources said totalled £156.8m.\nClub officials have defended the outlay, saying it provides evidence of United's determination to arrest their slump and compete for major trophies again.\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?"

    "content": "Vitor Pereira replaced Gary O'Neil as head coach at Molineux last December\nManager Vitor Pereira is close to a new Wolves deal despite their poor start to the season. The Portuguese's contract expires at the end of the campaign and an agreement is likely to come before this weekend.\nIt underlines the faith the club have in Pereira, who replaced Gary O'Neil in December.\nWolves, who host Leeds in the Premier League on Saturday, have lost their opening four league games to sit bottom of the table.\nThey beat West Ham in the EFL Cup in August but could become just the sixth team to lose their opening five games in Premier League history. Pereira took over with Wolves in the bottom three in December but guided them to 16th and safety, 17 points above the relegation zone. They won six successive Premier League games between March and April to secure survival early but have not won in the top flight since the end of that run, a 3-0 win over Leicester.\nExecutive chairman Jeff Shi said earlier this month the club needed Pereira to remain. \"Wolves need stability now - we need a coach to stay here and help us for a long time,\" he said. \"Every coach needs time and the jigsaw to be made. We should give the coach enough time and the players he needs to prepare for the season.\n\"I feel the more important thing to define this season is the squad and the coach, the chemistry and the unity. If you have that foundation, you will have a strong season. If you don't, maybe you have a doubt.\n\"Before Vitor came the team chemistry had some problems. This year that issue is gone. We have a strong team spirit and a very committed team structure.\""

    "content": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nLooking to learn a new language? Reading is a great way to start, and you don't need a physical book to do it: Here's how to change your Kindle's language (and download books in other languages!) to learn right from your favorite e-reader.\nReading a different language helps you expand your vocabulary and nail down nuances like sentence structure, and for visual learners like myself it can be the ideal way to start really learning information. Lucky for all of us e-reader lovers, Kindle's ebook store has books in all kinds of languages that you can purchase or download through Kindle's subscription services like Kindle Unlimited and Kids+. You can always send an ebook from your library that's in your learning language of choice to your e-reader, too.\nBut it's not just with books: You can change your Kindle's settings to switch the device itself to speak in one of 10 languages: German, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, and Chinese. Here's how to do it and how to find books in other languages.\nChanging the settings is pretty easy. You'll head to the Settings menu on your Kindle and select Device options, and then one of the options will be Languages and Dictionaries. You'll choose that option, and there will be four items to choose from: Language, Dictionaries, Keyboards, and Chinese Characters Sort Order.\nThe Language menu will do what you expect, letting you choose from among the device's 10 languages to set your device to. Changing the language will prompt the Kindle to restart and load itself in your chosen language, though the books in your library will remain in their original language. Dictionaries will give you options based on your language of choice. (English has two different Oxford dictionaries, for example.)\nKeyboards lets you add keyboards in different languages without actually changing your Kindle's overall language. There are more keyboard options—27 total—than language options on the Kindle. This is because some languages have more than one keyboard option: English, Spanish, and Japanese each have two keyboards to choose from, while Chinese has three. But you'll also see keyboards for other languages you can't change the entire device to, like Arabic and Swedish.\nThe final setting in the Languages menu will sort Chinese characters, if Chinese is a language you choose. There are three sort orders (Hanyu Pinyin, Stroke Order, and Zhuyin Fuhao) to choose from.\nIn the same way you can obtain books in your preferred language through various methods, you can also access books in different languages on your Kindle.\nThe easiest way is the Kindle Store, which has a Foreign Language section you can choose to find books in different languages to buy with your Amazon account. (You'll want to click the cart icon on the upper right in your library, then Browse Categories, See All Book Categories, and then Foreign Languages will be on that list to select). It'll let you filter by language and will show you the most popular options.\nMy best seller results seemed influenced by my own downloads in English, since Spanish versions of Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? that I loaded onto my Kindle Colorsoft Kids for my son immediately popped up. According to Redditors, you can also change your region on your Kindle device to get more ebook options in other languages that might not be available through Amazon's US store. That will require changing your settings for your entire Amazon account, though, so you'll have to get off your Kindle to do that work-around. You can also still add library ebooks or even download PDFs or other files in other languages to read them on your Kindle.\nStressed about where to start? It's usually recommended to start with a book you've read before to make it easier to learn the language; that way you don't have to worry about understanding the story. Happy reading in whatever language you please!\nDon't have a Kindle yet to take advantage of these features? Here are our favorite models, and you can learn all about every Kindle we've tried in our Best Kindles guide.\nAmazon\nAmazon\nAmazon (Signature)\nOur all-time favorite Kindle has an adjustable warm backlight you won't find on cheaper models.\nAmazon\nAmazon\nLove to take notes?

    "title": "Inside Trumpworld’s Reality Distortion Field",
    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/inside-trumpworlds-reality-distortion-field/",
    "content": "Before a suspect was even in custody, Trumpworld was on a wartime footing.\nCharlie Kirk had been fatally shot. Graphic video of the assassination hit terminal velocity online. Several sources of mine were close friends of Kirk, and when I spoke to them last week, it was clear this incident had changed the level of aggression with which they were willing to pursue a crackdown on their boss’s perceived enemies.\n“I think we want to confront violent left wing rhetoric. We want PEACE, and unity,” one adviser to President Donald Trump told me in a text message.\nBut, they continued, “If this is an organized group—which it seems?—then this is going to be a wake up call like people have never seen.” This person then speculated about an antifa cell in, of all places, central Utah. Other sources suggested that a band of transgender militants plotted the attack. (There is no indication that any organized group or cell planned the attack, with charging documents filed Tuesday indicating it was a lone shooter.)\nIt turned out that the nihilistic and highly online references inscribed on bullets investigators found near the crime scene weren’t, despite garbled early reporting, so cut-and-dried as to spell out a clear motive for Kirk’s murder.\nRepublicans kept running with one anyway.\nIn the week since Kirk’s death, mourning over his shocking loss has metastasized into an unprecedented mobilization effort among the MAGA base, focused on a few main fronts. There is the successful push for firings of regular civilians over the tone and content of their social media posts about Kirk’s death. There is a pendulum swing toward something approaching cancel culture and actual, government-backed censorship on big social media platforms. And then there are the preexisting priorities of the Trump administration.\n“They killed Charlie Kirk—the least that we can do is go through a legal process and redistrict Indiana into a nine-to-zero map,” representative Jim Banks of Indiana told Politico at a Republican confab over the weekend, pushing for more partisan gerrymandering.\nThere was talk of unity from some, but the more dominant tone was expressed by Vice President JD Vance when he hosted Kirk’s podcast. “There is no unity with people who scream at children over their parents' politics. There is no unity with someone who lies about what Charlie Kirk said in order to excuse his murder,” he said. “There is no unity with someone who harasses an innocent family the day after the father of that family lost a dear friend. There is no unity with the people who celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination.”\nElon Musk, on his long road back to regaining favor with the administration, went even further. Appearing remotely at a far-right rally in London on Saturday, he declared “The left are the party of murder.”\nAs time went on, there appeared to be only one source of true unity: Agreement between the ultra MAGA and Silicon Valley wings of the party over who the they responsible for Kirk’s murder really is.\nIt’s anyone Republican leaders want it to be.\nAccording to one expert, that’s the entire point: Trumpworld and its Republican allies, from influencers to tech overlords, have started to become the digital equivalent of high on their own supply.\n“Since 2020, quite clearly you've seen a media ecosystem that exists to reinforce and to mobilize the base around ideas that they consider to be advantageous for their political movement,” says Renee DiResta, a Georgetown University associate research professor specializing in conspiracy theories, terrorism, and state-sponsored information warfare. “And so the content creators, and the influencers, and the media outlets that reinforce those ideas are the ones that form a political machine,” DiResta adds, working “in tandem to create a self-reinforcing feedback loop.”\nAlready, Americans are getting fired over their social media posts about the Kirk shooting, and there’s no special reason to think the campaign will end soon, or stop there.\n“There’s a lot that I think is gonna come from this,” a Republican member of Congress close to President Trump tells me.\nAlmost immediately after the shooting, Republicans were both publicly and privately connecting the successful attempt on Kirk’s life to the two unsuccessful ones on Trump’s life last summer. No evidence anyone has made public supports such a claim. But sources of mine, including a second Trump adviser who was close to Kirk, were too overcome with emotion and too fed up with their political opposition to care all that much about the actual motivation of Kirk’s killer.\n“This is on them,” the second Trump adviser told me. “As were the two attempts on Trump’s life.”\nOf course, there is no organized “them” at play here beyond the broadest definition of the left. There is no evidence of an armed antifa cell in Utah, and none that Kirk’s killing was related to a presidential assassination plot. But when I sent new information about the shooter to my Trump sources—who, granted, were in grief and shock—that conflicted with their priors, they did not respond.\n“President Trump is right—for years, radical leftists have slandered their political opponents as Nazis and fascists, inspiring left-wing violence like the tragic assassination of Charlie Kirk,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, told me on Tuesday.\nAs of now, the evidence is something of a Rorschach test. Robinson’s mother told investigators he was beginning to “lean more to the left—becoming more pro-gay and trans-rights oriented,” according to the indictment filed by the Utah County attorney general in the state’s Fourth Judicial District Court Tuesday. When asked by his roommate why he allegedly shot Kirk in a text exchange included in the indictment, Robinson replied, “I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can’t be negotiated out,” according to the indictment. Leaked messages from a Discord in which Robinson was allegedly active, obtained by the journalist Ken Klippenstein, appear to complicate the picture, though, and no evidence that has been made public directly links the alleged killer to a specific political ideology.\nIt’s not a coincidence that ideological enemies of the broader conservative movement have been the targets of the mass firing push by Trump supporters. Americans working in education, health care, and government in particular have been targeted, and the right-wing news site Breitbart specifically mentioned those three categories in a post on X.\n“This isn’t ‘cancel culture,’” the post reads. “It’s self defense. A nation that empowers the deranged and the depraved is a nation marching toward ruin.”\nThe longer-term focus from the White House, the lawmaker close to Trump tells me, won’t be limited to just one social media site, such as Bluesky, where scores of posts were compiled and cataloged by the since-offline site “Expose Charlie’s Murderers,” as WIRED reported. Trumpworld wants to come for them all.\n“You’re going to continue to see this: Whether it’s Meta, Reddit, Bluesky, Roblox—all of ’em that are actually taking down any content that’s literally calling for more violence and/or recirculating that horrifying video,” the lawmaker told me. They also mentioned Discord as a target for the administration, alleging without evidence that the attack was “coordinated” there. (“These were communications between the suspect’s roommate and a friend after the shooting, where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere,” Discord VP of trust and safety Jud Hoffman said in a statement last Friday.)\nFighting against the perception of hypocrisy around cancel culture has already become a focal point of the right wing’s spin.\n“There is a big difference between the left canceling people and the right canceling people,” conservative influencer Matt Walsh tweeted over the weekend. “The left cancels you for saying things that are true. To the extent that the right cancels you, it is for saying things that are abhorrent and sick. A pretty important distinction.”\nFor DiResta, the pendulum swinging from maximum free speech and minimum content moderation to something approaching the very thing Republicans once opposed makes sense from the perspective of being caught in a conspiratorial information bubble.\n“Their opinions on content moderation, for example—redefining labeling and fact-checking as censorship—were always part of a political project to advantage their movement when viewed through that lens,” she says. “It makes sense that now they would be in favor of more censorship—I should say, more actual censorship, because in this particular case, what you're seeing is sitting agents of the government calling for the suppression of speech.”\nSome officials in the Trump administration have gone beyond calls for Americans to be banned from social media or be fired from their jobs.\nStephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy on paper and unofficial “prime minister” of Trumpworld, went as far as to call for RICO or conspiracy against the United States charges for those “fomenting riots, that are doxing, that are trying to inspire terrorism, or committing wanton acts of violence.” In remarks on Fox News over the weekend, Miller promised that “the power of law enforcement, under President Trump’s leadership, will be used to find you, will be used to take away your money, take away your power, and, if you’ve broken the law, to take away your freedom.”\nBy Monday, Miller was on Kirk’s podcast describing, in his uniquely dystopian way, a “vast domestic terror movement” and promising to use the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to “identify, disrupt, dismantle, and destroy these networks” in Kirk’s name. There is no evidence the movement he describes exists.\nThis type of rhetoric—a push for a no-holds-barred crackdown with the full force of the federal government—was shared by high-profile figures on the tech right such as Musk and Curtis Yarvin, who tweeted, “The firings are just the beginning!”\n“This is really the moment they can claim persecution again,” a source in the tech and crypto space tells me, having seen both on- and offline how their colleagues have radicalized over the past half decade. “Everything has to have some sort of conspiracy tie-in. Nothing can be simple, it has to tie into some broader narrative … This has to be indicative of an underground transgender terrorist network, as opposed to [anything else].”\nWhether they believe any of this or not, my source says, is immaterial.\n“I don’t know,” they say, “whether they believe what they’re saying, or if they just think it’ll get them the attention they want.”\nFor now, it might be both.\nThis is an edition of Jake Lahut’s Inner Loop newsletter.

    "title": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Is Bananas for Google Gemini’s AI Image Generator",
    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/jensen-huang-has-gone-nano-bananas/",
    "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is in London, standing in front of a room full of journalists, outing himself as a huge fan of Gemini’s Nano Banana. “How could anyone not love Nano Banana? I mean Nano Banana, how good is that? Tell me it’s not true!” He addresses the room. No one responds. “Tell me it’s not true! It’s so good. I was just talking to Demis [Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind] yesterday and I said ‘How about that Nano Banana! How good is that?’”\nIt looks like lots of people agree with him: The popularity of the Nano Banana AI image generator—which launched in August and allows users to make precise edits to AI images while preserving the quality of faces, animals, or other objects in the background—caused a 300 million–image surge for Gemini in the first few days of September, according to a post on X by Josh Woodward, VP of Google Labs and Google Gemini.\nHuang, whose company was among a cohort of big US technology companies to announce investments in data centers, supercomputers, and AI research in the UK on Tuesday, is on a high. Speaking ahead of a white-tie event with UK prime minister Keir Starmer (where he plans to wear custom black leather tails), he’s boisterously optimistic about the future of AI in the UK, saying the country is “too humble” about the country’s potential for AI advancements.\nHe cites the UK’s pedigree in themes as wide as the industrial revolution, steam trains, DeepMind (now owned by Google), and university researchers, as well as other tangential skills. “No one fries food better than you do,” he quips. “Your tea is good. You’re great. Come on!”\nNvidia announced a $683 million equity investment in data center builder Nscale this week, a move that—alongside investments from OpenAI and Microsoft—has propelled the company to the epicenter of this AI push in the UK. Huang estimates that Nscale will generate more than $68 billion in revenue over six years. “I’ll go on record to say I’m the best thing that’s ever happened to him,” he says, referring to Nscale CEO Josh Payne.\n“As AI services get deployed—I’m sure that all of you use it. I use it every day, and it’s improved my learning, my thinking. It’s helped me access information, access knowledge a lot more efficiently. It helps me write, helps me think, it helps me formulate ideas. So my experience with AI is likely going to be everybody’s experience. I have the benefit of using all the AI—how good is that?”\nThe leather-jacket-wearing billionaire, who previously told WIRED that he uses AI agents in his personal life, has expanded on how he uses AI (that’s not Nano Banana) for most daily things, including his public speeches and research.\n“I really like using an AI word processor because it remembers me and knows what I’m going to talk about. I could describe the different circumstance that I’m in, and yet it still knows that I’m Jensen, just in a different circumstance,” Huang explains. “In that way it could reshape what I’m doing and be helpful. It’s a thinking partner, it’s truly terrific, and it saves me a ton of time. Frankly, I think the quality of work is better.”\nHis favorite one to use “depends on what I’m doing,” he says. “For something more technical I will use Gemini. If I’m doing something where it’s a bit more artistic, I prefer Grok. If it’s very fast information access I prefer Perplexity—it does a really good job of presenting research to me. And for near everyday use I enjoy using ChatGPT,” Huang says.\n“When I am doing something serious, I will give the same prompt to all of them, and then I ask them to, because it’s research oriented, critique each other’s work. Then I take the best one.”\nIn the end though, all topics lead back to Nano Banana. “AI should be democratized for everyone. There should be no person who is left behind, it’s not sensible to me that someone should be left behind on electricity or the internet of the next level of technology,” he says.\n“AI is the single greatest opportunity for us to close the technology divide,” says Huang. “This technology is so easy to use—who doesn’t know how to use Nano?”"

    "url": "https://www.wired.com/review/samsung-hw-q990f/",
    "content": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n8/10\nIt’s hard to convince anyone to spend over a thousand dollars on a soundbar system. Ask a home theater nerd or Redditor, and they’ll say spending real cash on anything other than a receiver and dedicated speakers and subwoofer is a fool's errand. As an A/V reviewer, I see this as a hilariously case of gatekeeping.\nThese arguments are predicated on the fact that everyone has the room, know-how, and desire to deal with cables, speakers, and the associated setup. For those of us with partners who refuse to let us place all that stuff around our rooms, and who want real cinematic sound, wireless class D soundbar systems like the new Samsung HW-Q990F take out all the fuss and hardly compromise on sound relative to similarly priced traditional home theaters.\nJust place the bar below your TV, the subwoofer near an outlet, and the rear surrounds somewhere that they can bounce sound properly off the walls and ceiling, and you have a ready-to-go 11.1.4 system that sounds hilariously good for the lack of complexity.\nSure, you can’t swap out a receiver every time standards change, but I don’t see anything beyond Dolby Atmos (which this is more than capable of) coming down the line anytime soon. As long as you don’t fear change, a high-end soundbar system should be good enough for years. Samsung itself seems to know this well: The previous-gen model HW-Q990D is still for sale on its own website for the same price as the new bar.\nThe large cardboard box containing this soundbar system contains the main bar, a subwoofer, and two surround speakers. All except the main bar simply plug into the wall and instantly pair, with the main bar requiring a plug and an HDMI cable to plug into your TV.\nSamsung HW-Q990F\nRating: 8/10\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nIt’s an aesthetically pleasing setup but not one that visually stands out in my testing space, which makes it nice to hide in plain sight. The brushed perforated metal of the bar and surrounds feel hefty and look well made, with cool angles that hide speakers to bounce sound all over your room. The included subwoofer is a rounded square that is shockingly heavy at nearly 19 pounds. You can place it anywhere in a room; I recommend trying a few spots and seeing where it sounds best.\nOther than finding a spot for the speakers and woofer, you basically don’t need to do anything other than turn on your TV and make sure it is connected to the bar system (every model I tested this soundbar system with did so instantly), and you’re off to cinema land. It has an optical audio input, two HDMI inputs, and support for HDMI 2.1 pass-through, which means you can also plug in a 4K Blu-Ray player or gaming system into the bar, rather than having to plug it into your TV.\nThe top of the bar features four physical buttons for input selection, volume up and down, and a physical mute button for the microphone for folks who don't like Samsung creeping on them all the time. This is important, because this bar does have Amazon Alexa built in, which means it will yell at you constantly if you don't mute it and you are talking about a friend named Alex.\nThe included remote is the kind of boring black candy bar you actually don't need to touch once you adjust your initial settings, thanks to the fact that HDMI eARC lets your TV remote control the volume and mute the bar when needed.\nThe massive array of drivers in this compact system really does well to create an immersive listening experience in small to medium-size rooms. Like its predecessor, the HW-Q990D, Samsung showcases its excellent audio processing and driver selection here. It almost doesn’t seem possible that such a simple and compact system can generate musical energy like this.\nSamsung HW-Q990F\nRating: 8/10\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nMost people aren’t using physical media anymore, which is why I spent the majority of my time testing the HW-Q990F with streaming media. I find that Apple TV has the best audio quality of any of the major streaming services, which tracks with my experience testing this bar: Atmos-mixed shows like sci-fi hit Foundation come through with gorgeous clarity and dynamic bass as you’d expect with any soundbar worth its salt.\nIt's the overhead, object-based Atmos audio effects that really stagger me. Raindrops and creaky chairs seem to exist in my testing room with me; the burbling engines of Ford GT prototypes fill the room when watching Ford v Ferrari.\nSamsung has both stellar processing and the ability to bounce sounds around smaller and medium-size rooms nailed. The side speakers on the satellite drivers and the various angled speakers on the main bar really make you feel like you are being attacked on all sides by audio. I really loved the way sounds swirled around me when watching my 4K Blu-Ray copy of Blade Runner 2049, with wavy synths meeting ship sounds and rainy backgrounds among other on-screen noises in 3D space.\nThere's tons of adjustability when it comes to sound modes (Standard, Game, Surround, and Adaptive), EQ levels, and volume of each speaker, and I'd recommend tuning the settings to your personal taste in your specific room. I found the settings to be pretty bang-on out of the box; I have a fairly traditional home theater setup with two speaker stands behind my listening position and the subwoofer next to the TV stand, and it sounded great almost instantly (I did have to adjust the subwoofer level slightly up).\nThe soundbar can pair with modern Samsung TVs like the S95F in a mode Samsung calls Q-Symphony, allowing it to use the TV speakers in addition to the bar, subwoofer, and surrounds. I didn’t find this particularly enticing; it seemed to boost the highs a bit but didn’t really do much for overall immersion. If you have a Samsung TV, it’s worth trying both on and off, but this feature isn’t a deal breaker if you want an LG, Sony, TCL, Panasonic, or Hisense TV.\nThe best part of this system is that it works just fine with any other products in TV land, not just Samsung's. I love how easy it is to set up, and I love that it really does feel like it is offering me the highest-quality sound in the most compact package. The fact that last year's bar is still for sale (and still very similar sounding) is actually a plus: Samsung has pretty much nailed the existing needs of listeners at this point. There are very few soundbar systems that compete, but I'd say that higher-end bars from Sonos, Bose, and LG do give this system a run for its money. That said, none of them have this many channels done this well, which makes Samsung's HW-Q990F the top of the pile for me in 2025 so far.\nSamsung HW-Q990F\nRating: 8/10\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

    "title": "Apple iPhone Air Review: Better Than Expected",
    "url": "https://www.wired.com/review/apple-iphone-air/",
    "content": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n7/10\nThe iPhone 17 Pro felt like a brick. I had just gotten used to the featherweight feel of Apple's new iPhone Air after several days of use, but it was time to switch to the iPhone 17 Pro. Suddenly, I didn't want to let the Air go.\nIt's amazing how a couple of grams and a slimmer profile can drastically change the feel of a phone. There isn’t much to grab on the edges, but the Air's design is whimsical and somewhat paradoxical. It feels like a twig that can snap in a heartbeat, but the sturdy titanium frame dispels any notion of fragility.\nI was prepared to hate the iPhone Air. Why make a thin phone with lackluster battery life? A single-camera system for $999? After spending some time with it, I'm pleasantly surprised. I still don't think most people should buy it—it's for early adopters who want to experience Apple's thinnest iPhone to date—but it's a promising blueprint of what's to come.\nThe iPhone Air is just 5.6 millimeters thick and 165 grams; contrast that with the iPhone 17 Pro, which has a smaller screen yet weighs 206 grams and is 8.75 mm thick. It's a palpable difference. Initially, you might feel like the lighter weight makes the Air seem “cheap,” but that notion quickly disappears. This phone feels strong, durable, and rigid.\nI watched Apple perform a bend test on the iPhone Air, and it was able to withstand more than 130 pounds of force with no damage. I gave it a good bend test myself, but it didn't flex. We'll need to see how this phone performs in the hands of a wider audience, but I think you can put your pitchforks away—no #bendgate here. This durability stems from the use of titanium for the frame, along with Apple's new Ceramic Shield 2 protecting the display, and Ceramic Shield 1 layered over the back. Apple says this mixture makes the Air more durable than any prior iPhone.\nI can't imagine buying this ultrathin phone and putting a case on it, but I didn't mind Apple's bumper case. The phone still feels light and thin, but the slightly thicker edges of the bumper make it easier to grasp. Annoyingly, despite using a horizontal camera bar like Google's Pixel phones, the camera still sticks out enough that the Air rocks on a table when you tap a corner—a small nitpick.\nApple iPhone Air\nRating: 7/10\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nThe 6.5-inch OLED screen once again feels improbable in this thin and light design. It's just unusual to hold such a large screen and not find it heavy. The display now gets brighter, and I had no issues reading it in direct sunlight on clear, sunny days in California and New York. The inclusion of a 120-Hz screen refresh rate on a non-Pro iPhone is long overdue, and it helps this phone feel even more lively.\nIt's not wrong to say that the Air's thin and light design is pretty much all it has going for it, but that quality shouldn't be undervalued. Using this phone has genuinely been a treat over the usual bulky handsets that come my way. However, just how much you're able to enjoy it depends on what kind of battery life you're used to.\nApple is not using a silicon-carbon battery in the iPhone Air, despite rumors leading up to the September event. Instead, there's a high-density traditional lithium-ion battery, along with a raft of optimizations in iOS 26, the A19 Pro chipset, a new power-efficient C1X modem, and a fresh internal design. All this to say: The battery life of the iPhone Air is better than I expected.\nApple iPhone Air\nRating: 7/10\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nThe Air was generally able to last a full day with average use for me. I hit around five hours of screen-on time with around 18 percent left by 10:30 pm. This worked for me, but my expectations were also very low. I had to baby the battery so much on the last ultrathin phone I tested, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, and I was surprised to find that this was not the case with the Air.\nHeavy users will undoubtedly need to top up this phone during the day. On one travel day, I took the phone off the charger at 5:30 am and used it extensively for navigation, music streaming, phone calls, and Instagram Reeling, and I hit 2 percent by 4:30 pm. If that sounds like a very normal day for you, you'll most certainly feel the limits of this phone's battery life. For the most part, I didn't feel as battery anxious as with Samsung's thin phone.\nI also tested Apple's iPhone Air MagSafe Battery, and it's nice that it snugly fits the Air's body, but it awkwardly has to sit horizontally on other iPhone models. Unfortunately, it doesn't deliver a full charge. It took around an hour and 20 minutes to completely deplete the thing, returning 68 percent to the Air from 0 percent.\nThe Apple-designed C1X modem is supposedly 30 percent more energy-efficient than the modem on the iPhone 16 Pro, but how does this new chip affect connectivity? You don't get millimeter-wave 5G support—that's the ultrafast flavor of 5G you'll find in some locations, like dense urban areas, airports, and stadiums. That means the iPhone Air is limited to sub-6 5G, which is what you connect to most of the time, but it's not as speedy as mmWave. It's a little bizarre to spend $999 on a phone and not get both versions of 5G, considering that's just about standard today, but the omission wasn't noticeable in my day-to-day use.\nApple iPhone Air\nRating: 7/10\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nI didn't run into any connectivity issues. In my internet speed tests, the C1X modem delivered download and upload speeds that were sometimes faster than the iPhone 17 Pro Max.\nWhat's not so great are thermals. Apple spent a great deal of time talking about the new vapor chamber cooling system on the iPhone 17 Pro models, but you'll find none of that here. Perform any intensive tasks on the iPhone Air, and the area around the camera module will feel very hot. I didn't deal with any thermal issues during normal use because most of what I do on my phone doesn't require immense processing. But my benchmark testing delivered interesting results.\nThe lesser A19 inside the iPhone 17 scored higher in benchmark tests and didn't run as hot as the A19 Pro in the iPhone Air. Mind you, all of these iPhones still got hot, but the iPhone 17 Pro's heat was spread out, so it didn't feel as though one spot was very hot. The other two devices had hot spots, but I measured 110 degrees on the iPhone 17—matching the Pro Max—and 115 degrees on the Air after about an hour of Assassin's Creed Mirage. That extra heat throttled performance a tiny bit, making the game a little more stuttery than on the Pro Max. Another Geekbench test also showed the Air scoring lower than the iPhone 17.\nHowever, Assassin's Creed Mirage performed significantly worse on the iPhone 17 at max graphical settings. It had far more stutters and, dare I say, was a little too annoying to call playable. So while the Air may get hotter and fall behind in some benchmarks, the reality is nuanced. The faster CPU cache, 12 GB of RAM, and other enhancements in the A19 Pro deliver a decent performance boost over the iPhone 17.\nApple iPhone Air\nRating: 7/10\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nMost people aren't going to notice any of this because the A19 and A19 Pro are plenty powerful to handle most apps and games with ease. However, folks who play games with demanding graphics will probably want to look to the iPhone 17 Pro models for the best graphical experience (they also have the best battery life, allowing for longer play times).\nThe biggest problem with the iPhone Air is its lone 48-MP camera. It feels extremely limiting. Even Samsung was able to stuff an extra ultrawide on the similarly thin Galaxy S25 Edge. In some low-light shots, I found that the iPhone 17's main camera delivered sharper images than the Air sometimes, too. (The sensor on the Air is the same as on the iPhone 17.) While the iPhone 17 can enjoy macro photography, the iPhone Air can't get as close to subjects. You can snap some great photos with the Air—the upgraded 24-MP selfie camera (binned to 18 MP) is nice—but the camera is just not a focal point.\nThe Air does have the new square-shaped selfie sensor, which lets you hold the phone in portrait orientation and snap photos in either portrait or landscape without changing your grip! Annoyingly, when you manually tap the landscape button to take a landscape selfie, it turns off Center Stage (the auto-zoom-out and auto-rotate). However, when you leave the camera instance and wait a few minutes, Center Stage should turn back on automatically the next time you launch the camera.\nAs usual, video quality on the iPhone Air remains excellent. I shot several comparison video clips with the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, and the iPhones routinely came out on top, whether it was the iPhone Air or the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Dual Capture is another fun new addition that lets you capture video with the front and rear camera simultaneously, and while Samsung has had this feature for years, the video quality is so much better on the iPhone.\nApple iPhone Air\nRating: 7/10\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nThe iPhone Air's performance was better than expected, but the asking price is too high. Most people will be better served by the iPhone 17, which has a better balance of power, battery life, and a more versatile camera system. For anyone who wants a thicker phone with better battery life, well, Apple has given you exactly that in the form of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max. (Also, why does the iPhone Air still only support USB 2 data transfer speeds?)\nThe Air showcases just what Apple is capable of when it controls the chips, hardware, and software, in a thin and light design that might be a bedrock for a potential folding iPhone. I don't doubt that there will be a demographic of people who don't take many photos or don't need heaps of battery life that will enjoy the thin and lightweight iPhone Air, much like the devoted group that loved the iPhone Mini. We'll have to wait and see if the Air sticks around, or if it will shortly be replaced by (a folding) something else.\nApple iPhone Air\nRating: 7/10\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

    "content": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n9/10\nAt first glance, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max seem like a drastic upgrade over their predecessors. They have a fantastic new look—one that adds more character with a two-tone design highlighting the blend of the aluminum chassis and glass. The “Camera Plateau,” as Apple calls it, elongates the camera module and gives it a more balanced appearance and feel. (Although I have to say, Google did it first.)\nThe specs might not read as revolutionary on paper: a bigger battery, a brighter screen, better performance, and a new telephoto zoom camera. There's no singular feature that'll make you go, “Wow!” But when you actually experience these individual improvements, they combine to become more than the sum of their parts. There are no major AI features being shoved down your throat (for various reasons). It's a better iPhone in every way.\nThe Cosmic Orange color was calling my name, but alas, Apple provided me with the Silver iPhone 17 Pro Max and Deep Blue iPhone 17 Pro. I switched to these phones after using the iPhone Air for several days, and I yelled, “Holy crap,” after picking them up. They are heavier than the iPhone 16 Pro models, and they feel like bricks compared to the thin and light Air.\nI like the Camera Plateau. The two-tone separation of glass and aluminum just makes it more visually interesting. You might say, “It's just a phone,” but when a gadget looks and feels great, it makes using it all the more enjoyable, and I think Apple has done a nice job here. The phone also no longer rocks on a table as much as before, so, yay!\nApple switched from titanium to aluminum to make these chunky phones lighter, but the material change also improves thermal conductivity. Talking about heat dissipation isn't sexy (it is hot), but it's a key improvement in the new iPhones. When you're playing a graphically intensive game, your iPhone will start to get very hot as the processor does its job. At a certain point, if things get too hot, the processor starts to throttle itself so it doesn't overheat, but it means your performance suffers, resulting in stuttering and skips in your gameplay. With the iPhone 17 Pro models, Apple is finally using a vapor chamber cooling system to help dissipate heat.\nApple iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max\nRating: 9/10\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nSeveral Android phones have long used vapor chamber cooling systems, so the technology isn't new. There's literally one droplet of water in the iPhone, turning to vapor as it absorbs heat and spreads it across the back of the phone, then phasing back into water as it cools down. This system should bring several benefits: better sustained performance over a period of time, and a phone that doesn't get too hot in one awkward spot.\nThis rang true in my tests. I played one of the most demanding games on the iPhone right now—Assassin's Creed Mirage—and performance was significantly smoother than when I played it on the iPhone 16 Pro last year. The iPhone 17 Pro still got hot, but the heat was spread out over the entire back of the phone, so it didn't feel as uncomfortable to hold while gaming (unlike the iPhone 17 and Air). I maxed out the graphical settings, and the frames per second were noticeably more stable, and I rarely saw stutters at all.\nApple's more powerful A19 Pro chipset has a lot to do with this as well. Keep in mind that performance is slightly better than the A19 Pro inside the iPhone Air, which lacks a graphics core. When I played Mirage on the Air, the phone got hotter in specific areas and wasn't fun to hold. I saw more stutters during prolonged gameplay, though the game was still playable. I also tried it out on the A19-powered iPhone 17, but it stuttered so often at max graphics that I had to stop. All this to say, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are the most powerful smartphones around. The benchmark scores blew everything else out of the water.\nApple iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max\nRating: 9/10\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nThe second major highlight is the beefier batteries. Scour phone forums over the last decade and you'll find hundreds of posts asking why phones aren't a little thicker to accommodate a bigger battery. Well, Apple did exactly that. The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are thicker and have the highest battery life claims from Apple to date: 33 hours of video playback on the Pro and 39 hours on the Pro Max.\nIn real-world testing, I haven't worried about battery life on either of these phones. I'm using the Pro Max right now, which has more than 5 hours of screen-on time (SoT) and 55 percent left in the tank. I hit nearly seven hours of SoT on the iPhone 17 Pro, and it still had 30 percent left. Much will depend on what you're doing—hours of gaming will deplete the cell much faster—but I think there's a good chance you might not have to charge your iPhone every single day anymore, especially with the Pro Max.\nThe rest of the hardware has been excellent. The displays get super bright for easy viewing in sunny conditions, they recharge fairly quickly with the right adapter, and these remain the only iPhone models with USB 3 data transfer speeds. The two Pro models are nearly indentical in features and specs, outside of size (and battery life): The iPhone 17 Pro has a 6.3-inch screen, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max has a 6.9-inch panel. The latter is harder to wield, but it does have one extra perk: You can upgrade to 2 terabytes of internal storage.\nI feel comfortable saying that the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are the current smartphone camera kings, at least in the US. (I haven't compared them with many of the crazy 1-inch cameras from Chinese competitors like Xiaomi and Huawei.) I trotted around New York City with the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge in tow and compared photos and videos in various environments.\nUnsurprisingly, the results across all of these phones aren't drastically different. There are moments when a competing phone outperforms the iPhone (usually, the Pixel 10 Pro). But by and large, I found the iPhone's photos a hair sharper than its peers, though it didn't always handle challenging situations the best or nail skin tones perfectly.\nApple iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max\nRating: 9/10\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nI very much enjoy the new 4X optical zoom camera, and the optical-like quality when you bump up to 8X zoom. It might not always best Google's telephoto camera, but it certainly can impress. The 18-MP selfies on the new iPhones are sharper than ever and competitive, though I still prefer my skin tone rendered on the Pixel. In some low-light scenes, the shadows feel like they've been lifted a bit too much, whereas the Pixel 10 Pro XL had nicer contrast. These iPhones also still have trouble with Portrait mode in low light, a feat the Pixel handles without much issue.\nBut a big part of what makes these iPhone cameras so excellent is video performance, which is unparalleled. They have superior stabilization over the competition, whether it's with the front or rear cameras. Switching between lenses during recording is smooth and seamless, and low-light video quality is far less grainy. Google is able to come close with its cloud-processing Video Boost technology (not always), but you have to enable this, and also wait for the cloud to deliver your processed footage, which could take hours.\nTake Dual Capture, a new feature on these new models. You can shoot with the front and rear cameras simultaneously, something you've been able to do with third-party apps before. Samsung has offered this feature on its Galaxy phones for years. But when I tested it, the Galaxy S25 Edge's low-light video footage in Dual Recording mode looked awful next to Dual Capture on the iPhone 17 Pro. Sometimes, it pays to be second.\nI do want to highlight the square-shaped camera sensor for the 24-MP selfie camera (binned to 18 MP). It's standard on all the new iPhone 17 models, and it lets you grip your iPhone sturdily in portrait orientation, but capture selfies or shoot videos in portrait or landscape orientation. It's genius, and something I hope every phone maker copies in the next year. No need to awkwardly shift your grip and risk dropping the phone.\nThat's the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max. No one with an iPhone 15 and newer needs to upgrade (iPhone 14 and iPhone 13 owners might be fine if your device is performing OK, but the switch to USB-C might be warranted). Better heat management delivers better sustained performance. Better battery life means less charging, maximizing your battery health. And the improved cameras keep it at the top of the smartphone camera rankings. What's not to love? And I didn't even have to say “Apple Intelligence” once.\nApple iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max\nRating: 9/10\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

    "title": "WIRED’s Best E-Readers, Tested and Reviewed (2025): Kindle, Kobo, Boox",
    "url": "https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-ereaders/",
    "content": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nAmazon\nKobo (With Stylus 2)\nAmazon\nAmazon\nNothing will ever really replace a paperback or a hardcover book, but these e-readers will give you the best digital version of that experience. E-readers (short for ebook readers) are just so convenient—and they might just make you read more too. Rather than lumping two or three books in a bag, an e-reader lets you carry thousands of books or dozens of audiobooks in a single, slim, rectangular tablet. Their paperlike screens are easy on the eyes, and unlike an app on your phone, they won’t inundate you with distracting notifications. Books can also be expensive and take up a lot of physical space, but that’s not a problem with ebooks. Even better, you can check out digital books from a library without leaving your house.\nNaturally, when you hear “e-reader,” you might think Kindle. Amazon makes the best ebook reader, the 12th-generation Kindle Paperwhite ($160), and we've even got an entire Best Kindles guide that breaks down the full Kindle lineup. But there are some great non-Amazon e-readers out there too. If you're looking for one that has a color screen, for example, our favorite comes from Kobo: the Kobo Libra Colour ($230). We're also fans of the Boox Palma 2 ($300) if you want an e-reader that's smartphone sized.\nLooking for more reader recommendations? Don't miss our guides to the Best Kindles, Best Digital Notebooks, Best Reading Lights, Best Kindle Accessories, and Best Gifts for Book Lovers.\nUpdated September 2025: We've added a new FAQ section to this guide and ensured updated links and prices.\nAmazon\nAmazon\nAmazon (Signature)\nOur favorite e-reader is hands-down Amazon's Kindle Paperwhite. Kindles are a big favorite for e-readers, and the Paperwhite is a great option to get all the best features you can out of these devices. The Paperwhite was just updated last year with the 12th generation that has a larger display and a higher contrast ratio, so text and images look sharper than ever. It's a little thinner, too, at just 7.8 millimeters thick (the previous generation was 8.1 millimeters, so not a huge difference).\nThe 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite comes in both a regular and Signature edition. The Signature costs $40 more, but comes with a handful of extra features, including wireless charging, auto-adjusting brightness and slightly more storage. Both versions promise a three-month battery life, which is a relief to any reader who doesn't want to worry about constant recharging of their devices. It's also easy to get books with both Amazon's Kindle Store and a Kindle Unlimited membership, plus Kindles work with apps like Libby from Overdrive to access library ebooks, and can download other formats like PDFs for you to read.\nIf you're shopping for a Kindle, it's worth remembering that the best time to get a Kindle is during sale events like Amazon Prime Day or other similar holiday sales. If you can wait for one of these, we recommend it. —Nena Farrell\nKobo\nKobo (With Stylus 2)\nKobo (With Case and Stylus)\nMy husband once asked me if there was an e-reader option outside of Amazon. You bet there is! Kobo makes a great range of e-readers that pack all the benefits of a Kindle, no Amazon account required. Kobo does an especially good job with its range of color e-readers, letting you annotate directly onto books with colorful notes and highlights. Our favorite is the Kobo Libra Colour. Not only is this model small and colorful, but it comes with page-turn buttons and has a digital notebooks section that you won't find on most e-readers, especially at this price. You'll have to add on the Stylus 2 ($70) for writing, but even with the stylus, it's still cheaper than Kobo's Elipsa 2E and the Kindle Scribe. You will have to charge the stylus separately, though, which is a little annoying.\nNot only does the Libra Colour pack an affordable color screen, but it's 7-inch screen also packs an adjustable front light, dark mode, and can be rotated to landscape mode for reading. It's also made from recycled materials, is waterproof (rated IPX8), and has Bluetooth support to listen to audiobooks. Kobo also works with Overdrive's Libby app, though it takes a little more effort to connect to than using Libby with a Kindle. It's also repairable, though we haven't come across anything that needs fixing yet. —Nena Farrell\nBoox\nAmazon\nBoox\nBoox's phone-sized Palma 2 e-reader is mostly the same as its predecessor. It adds fingerprint recognition and has a faster CPU and a newer version of Android. When I click and swipe through the two side by side, the Palma 2 is noticeably faster and smoother than the original, but the bar is still low. It’s not going to replace your smartphone anytime soon, and E Ink is still less responsive than a touchscreen. I find it ever so slightly laggy to type and swipe, enough that I it’s annoying to check my emails or to search anything.\nIt’s egregious that this little pocket-sized e-reader costs $300, because if it cost $100, I would tell everyone to buy it. With the Kindle app, it’s a truly delightful thing to flip through a few pages on your tiny, palm-sized e-reader while standing in line to board a plane. It’s about the same size as the original Palma, at 6.3 inches long and 3.1 inches wide, has Bluetooth connectivity, can connect to Wi-Fi, and has 6 GB of RAM. If you’re going to buy this, I would also recommend the flip-fold protective case over the phone-style open-front case. Again, if there were a little half-size Kindle that costs $100, that would be great. —Adrienne So\nAmazon\nAmazon\nAmazon's basic Kindle is a great option if you’re looking for an affordable and compact ebook reader. The latest model comes with a few upgrades, including a higher-resolution screen, a brighter front light, and a faster page-turn rate. But you’ll likely only notice a difference if you’re coming from an even older model (not the 2022 version).\nIt’s light, comfortable to hold with one hand, and small enough to fit into most bags. The changes are also very noticeable if you're coming from an older model (like the 2019 version). The performance is smoother, the brighter screen looks a lot better during both the day and night, and the text is sharper. The overall experience is just a lot more enjoyable, especially during longer reading sessions. The Matcha color is also super adorable. It's worth shelling out for the Paperwhite, but if your budget is tight, this one does the job. —Brenda Stoylar\nAmazon\nAmazon\nThe kid-friendly Kindles got an update in 2024 with the same features as the non-Kid variants. My 7- and 9-year-old have been using the Kindle Kids since the first versions launched. To my eye (looking over their shoulders), the images are noticeably clearer and sharper and the page turn speeds faster in the latest models.\nThe reason you get a Kindle Kids instead of repurposing your old Kindle is the kid-friendly case, which also has fun designs that my kids like very much. You also get six months of access to Amazon Kids+, the company's subscription service that includes tons of age-appropriate books, including lots of books in Spanish, and a two-year warranty. My 7-year-old likes the smaller size of the basic (and cheaper) Kindle Kids ($130), and he also likes the kid-friendly covers better. However, my 9-year-old likes the bigger display on the Kids Paperwhite, which is better for reading graphic novels. I also prefer the Paperwhite over the basic Kindle because it's waterproof, and she reads poolside at her brother's swimming lessons. —Adrienne So\n★ A Color Option: There's now a Kindle Colorsoft Kids ($270) which is essentially a Colorsoft Kindle that comes with a fun cover and a year's worth of Amazon Kids+ content. You'll get a longer window of free Kids+ access with this model than Amazon's other Kids models, and it's a good option for kids who love graphic novels or comic books.\nBelow, you'll find a few more e-readers we like but don't necessarily love as much as our top picks.\nKindle Scribe 2024 for $400: The second-generation Kindle Scribe is a great option if you want an e-reader that doubles as a digital notebook, but also want to remain within the Kindle ecosystem. It has a 10.2-inch (300 ppi) paperlike display with features like adjustable warm light and an auto-adjusting front light. The included Premium Pen also has a soft-tipped eraser (mimicking that of a No.2 pencil). With Active Canvas and expandable margins, you can also mark up ebooks and write notes in the side panel.\nNook GlowLight 4 Plus for $200: The 4 Plus is the only waterproof Nook in the lineup, and it has the biggest screen at 7.8 inches, along with 32 GB of storage. It also has physical page-turn buttons and a headphone jack for listening to audiobooks (but you can also connect wireless earbuds via Bluetooth). But it was often slower than my Kindle and tended to freeze. While the large library has cheap and even free ebooks, it's not as good a selection as Kindle Unlimited. The process of getting a book from the library on a Nook is also beyond frustrating. You'll need to download either Adobe Digital Editions or Android File Transfer before connecting the device to your computer physically and then transferring the files.\nKindle Colorsoft\nKindle Colorsoft Signature for $280: The Kindle Colorsoft Signature is Amazon's first Kindle with a color screen. It has a screen with an oxide backplane, which Amazon says delivers better contrast and image quality along with custom-formulated coatings and nitride LEDs for brightness and color accuracy. But the screen is capped at 150 ppi for color images, versus 300 ppi for black and white, and the experience of reading is still a little fuzzier when compared to the latest Paperwhite. It takes noticeably longer to process color images, too. It's missing features that are by now standard on other color e-readers, like page turn buttons and stylus support. It's not a bad Kindle, and color does enrich the whole e-reading experience, but we suggest waiting for a discount during an Amazon sale event. Kindle has since launched a cheaper option, the Kindle Colorsoft ($250) that has less storage (only 16 GB, verus 32 GB) and no auto-adjusting light or wireless charging.\nKobo Clara Colour for $160: Our testers have really liked this color e-reader, especially compared to the Kindle Colorsoft. It's more affordable, but you still get to see book covers or graphic novels in full color, and you can highlight in color too. In testing, we found that some books weren't as easy on the eyes, like the blue-and-yellow color scheme of Curious George, but that was one small gripe in an otherwise seamless reading experience. The Clara lacks page-turn buttons, but the 6-inch screen size is comfortable for one-handed use. It has 16 gigabytes of storage rather than 32, but that's still about 12,000 books. There's Overdrive integration and Bluetooth support. It's also waterproof, made from recycled materials, and is repairable. Kobo just announced a new white colorway for this e-reader.\nNook 9-inch Lenovo Tablet for $150: If you mainly read cookbooks or other color-intensive materials, and you want a dedicated reader, you might want to consider this affordable tablet from Nook and Lenovo, which has the Nook app built in. As with the tablets mentioned above, you lose the E Ink screen and the distraction-free nature of an e-reader. You can at least turn off notifications while in certain apps, which I recommend doing for the Nook app. It ships with an old version of Android, and it's not built for heavy work like video or photo editing.\nHow Do You Get Ebooks?\nEbooks can be cheap, but as with regular books, the cost can add up if you're a big reader. You should take advantage of your library card and check out ebooks instantly from the comfort of your home. We have a detailed guide that explains how to get free library books, but the short version is that most libraries distribute books via OverDrive. You can access these books a few ways, through Kindle or directly from OverDrive with a Kobo, or you can download the Libby app. These ebooks are automatically removed from your device and returned to the library when they're due.\nEach e-reader's own book service varies in quality. Our favorite is Kindle Unlimited for $12 a month, which includes millions of titles, including audiobooks and magazines. Amazon's Prime Reading also offers a handful of free books every month, which is good to know if you already have a Prime account. You can even lend books to friends and family for a short while (or have them share a book with you). We have a roundup of the Best Ebook Subscription Services here.\nWhat File Formats Do E-Readers Support?\nThe most widely used format is ePub, which works natively with all the e-readers in this guide except for Kindle—technically. You can still upload ePub files to your Kindle, but you'll have use the “Send to Kindle” feature (through Amazon, your email, or the Kindle app) to convert it to Amazon's proprietary format called AZW. (Newer Kindles support AZW3 and KFX, specifically). Other formats that will work with these e-readers include PDF, TXT, HTML, DOC, and DOCX.\nCan I Install Apps on an E-Reader?\nThe Kindle, Kobo, and Nook use proprietary operating systems that don't allow you to install third-party apps. The Boox, on the other hand, runs Android (mainly Android 11 and newer). So, that means you can use it to download any apps available in the Google Play Store or side-load apps from your computer.\nDo You Need an E-Reader? What About a Phone or Tablet?\nYou don't have to buy a separate device to read ebooks. Smartphones and tablets are perfect for this purpose. You can use Amazon's Kindle app to read ebooks (iOS, Android), and even download OverDrive's Libby app (iOS, Android) for library book access anywhere as well. However, the E Ink screens found in e-readers are just nicer to look at. I also like that these devices are one-trick ponies; there are no notifications to be distracted by or social media feeds to doomscroll through.\nIf you'd still rather have one smart device you can read on and use for other purposes, take a look at our Best Tablets and Best iPads guides for recommendations.\nWhat About a Digital Notebook?\nWe’ve tried a few E Ink tablets meant for taking “handwritten” notes that can be organized and searched digitally. E-readers with that capability still prioritize reading. If the Kobo Libra Colour isn't big enough for your note-taking needs, you might prefer these. Right now, our favorite E Ink tablet is the $679 ReMarkable Paper Pro which lets you take notes with a responsive stylus on a color E Ink screen. However, it's not meant for reading—you can read PDFs on it, but the experience of getting books on it is far from seamless compared to Kobos and Kindles.\nHow Does WIRED Test E-Readers?\nThe most important thing we do when testing e-readers is read on them! We spend hours reading books acquired in a variety of formats, from books purchased directly from each brand's store, downloaded from local libraries via OverDrive/Libby, or PDFs acquired for free from God knows where.\nIn the process, we evaluate battery life, brightness, lag, screen responsiveness, and text sharpness. We check for extra tools like annotation, and whether or not the tablet accommodates accessories like a stylus. We also note if the tablet has other features, like waterproofing or access to great exclusive subscription services.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/this-giant-subterranean-neutrino-detector-is-taking-on-the-mysteries-of-physics/",
    "content": "Located 700 meters underground near the city of Jiangmen in southern China, a giant sphere—35 meters in diameter and filled with more than 20,000 tons of liquid—has just started a mission that will last for decades. This is Juno, the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory, a new, large-scale experiment studying some of the most mysterious and elusive particles known to science.\nNeutrinos are the most abundant particles in the universe with mass. They are fundamental particles, meaning they don’t break down into smaller constituent parts, which makes them very small and very light. They also have zero electrical charge; they are neutral—hence their name. All of this means that they very often don’t interact with other matter they come into contact with, and can pass right through it without affecting it, making them difficult to observe. It’s for this reason that they’re sometimes referred to as “ghost particles.”\nThey also have the ability to shift (or “oscillate”) between three different forms, also known as “flavors”: electron, mu, and tau. (Note that electron-flavored neutrinos are different from electrons; the latter are a different type of fundamental particle, with a negative charge.)\nThe fact that neutrinos oscillate was proven by the physicists Takaaki Kajita and Arthur Bruce McDonald. In two separate experiments, they observed that electron-flavored neutrinos oscillate into mu- and tau-flavored neutrinos. As a result they demonstrated that these particles have mass, and that the mass of each flavor is different. For this, they won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2015.\nAn explainer on neutrino oscillations from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.\nBut an important yet still unknown fact is how these masses are ordered—which of the three flavors has the greatest mass, and which the least. If physicists had a better understanding of neutrino mass, this could help better describe the behavior and evolution of the universe. This is where Juno comes in.\nNeutrinos can’t be seen with conventional particle detectors. Instead, scientists have to look for the rare signs of them interacting with other matter—and this is what Juno’s giant sphere is for. Called a scintillator, it’s filled with a sensitive internal liquid made up of a solvent and two fluorescent compounds. If a neutrino passing through this matter interacts with it, it will produce a flash of light. Surrounding the liquid is a massive stainless steel lattice that supports a vast array of highly sensitive light sensors, called photomultiplier tubes, capable of detecting even a single photon produced by an interaction between a neutrino and the liquid, and converting it into a measurable electrical signal.\n“The Juno experiment picks up the legacy of its predecessors, with the difference that it is much larger,” says Gioacchino Ranucci, deputy head of the experiment and the former head of Borexino, another neutrino-hunting experiment. One of the main features of Juno, Ranucci explains, is that Juno can “see” both neutrinos and their antimatter counterpart: antineutrinos. The former are typically produced in Earth’s atmosphere or by the decay of radioactive materials in Earth’s crust, or else arrive from outer space—coming from stars, black holes, supernovae, or even the Big Bang. Antineutrinos, however, are artificially produced, in this case by two nuclear power plants located near the detector.\n“As they propagate, neutrinos and antineutrinos continue to oscillate, transforming into each other,” Ranucci says. Juno will be able to capture all of these signals, he explains, showing how they oscillate, “with a precision never before achieved.”\nJuno’s primary goal is to find a solution to the neutrino mass-ordering problem. It’s known that the electron-flavored neutrino weighs less than the mu-flavored neutrino, but it’s not yet understood whether the third neutrino flavor, tau, weighs more than the other two (in which case, we would speak of a direct hierarchy) or not (in which case, an inverse hierarchy). By measuring, in very high resolution, the energy spectrum of antineutrinos from the reactors, Juno aims to show whether the hierarchy is normal or inverse. The collaboration expects that after about six years of data collection, it should have something approaching a statistically significant finding in answer to the question.\nBut that’s not all that’s in store for the experiment. At a still later stage, it could help solve an even deeper mystery concerning the so-called Majorana neutrino—a theorized particle that has never been observed. (Majorana particles are particles that are simultaneously also their own antiparticles; a Majorana neutrino is therefore both a neutrino and its antineutrino.) Being able to understand whether or not neutrinos are Majorana particles would possibly mean getting to the bottom of one of the most complex questions in modern physics, namely why more matter is observed in the universe than antimatter, for which there is still no complete, coherent, and definitive explanation.\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED Italia and has been translated from Italian."

    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/meta-connect-2025-how-to-watch/",
    "content": "Meta Connect, the annual event that serves as both the company’s developer conference and a platform for its new hardware announcements, is happening this week.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to take the stage at 5 pm Pacific, 8 pm Eastern, and 1 am British Summer Time on Wednesday, September 17, to announce a fleet of new smart glasses. We also expect to hear some updates on Meta’s machine intelligence efforts, and maybe a hint or two about how things are going at the company’s fledgling AI superintelligence lab.\nYou can watch the video of the Meta Connect livestream from Meta’s Horizon site or on the Meta for developers Facebook page. Unlike Apple or Google, Meta doesn’t stream its conference keynote on YouTube.\nIf you’re all in on the virtual reality future, you can also watch the event on a Meta Quest headset by going into the Horizon page and selecting the VR viewing option.\nIf you’re a developer and want to register for Connect, you can do that by plugging your name and email into the Meta Connect website. In the upper-right corner, look for a button that reads “Register for the livestream.” Enter your information and you’ll get information about additional presentations and developer sessions.\nWhile there may be some surprises at the event, Meta did fumble its reveal earlier this week when it accidentally leaked images of some new glasses that seem queued up to be announced at Connect. The leaked image includes the word Display, which could hint that Meta is looking to put out a new pair of glasses with an actual display built into the lenses.\nThe company showed off its ambitions for such a wearable device at its Connect event last year when it debuted its prototype Orion frames, which relied on a wristband for navigation and a wireless puck for connectivity and computing power. The design of last year’s frames used waveguide technology to create virtual displays of images, text, and videos that appear in the wearer’s vision. Developers have had access to Orion frames for a year, so the technology is likely ready for its next step.\nWe’re also expecting new models of the smart glasses developed by Meta and its main brand partners, Ray-Ban and Oakley.\nTune in at 5 pm Pacific on Wednesday for more coverage of Meta Connect 2025 as it happens live."

    "title": "Mushroom Supplements Are the Biohackers’ Latest Fix (2025)",
    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-wired-guide-to-mushroom-supplements/",
    "content": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFrom ancient remedies to your Amazon cart, mushroom supplements have traveled a circuitous road. They nourish the body, enhance the mind, and occasionally poison the unlucky. Their biochemical adaptability has intrigued Eastern cultures for centuries. The West has been slow to embrace mushrooms until the 21st century, propelled in part by endorsements from celebrities like Gisele Bündchen and Gwen Stefani.\nToday, in a zeitgeist fixated on biohacking and self-optimization, mushrooms are now tools for functional wellness. Gone are the days of foraging and sautéing. Instead, we embrace microdosing. We’re enjoying lion’s mane extract in our adaptogenic lattes and mixing non-GMO cordyceps into our post-workout smoothies, aiming to enhance our cognitive function, boost our gut health, and upgrade our immune systems. Health care researchers are also exploring their potential applications, ranging from cancer therapies to supportive treatments for Covid-19.\nFor more mushroom coverage, check out our guides to the Best Mushroom Gummies and Best Mushroom Coffee.\nUpdated September 2025: I've added Om Master Blend Mushroom Gummies, Plant People WonderDay Mushroom Gummies, Slumber Rest & Renew Mushroom Sleep Gummies, and Laird Superfood Organic Coffee with Functional Mushrooms as new favorites. I've also updated information, prices, and links.\nFunctional mushrooms, often referred to as medicinal or adaptogenic, offer more than just nutritional value. The excitement surrounding them isn’t due to recent studies; their advantages have been recognized for years. What has shifted is the way they are presented, allowing for simpler integration into contemporary lifestyles without the need for cooking. Brands like Ryze and PlantFusion have played a significant role in transforming these fungi from traditional remedies to nootropic supplements.\n“One of the OG brands was Four Sigmatic,” recalls Brigitte Zeitlin, a NYC-based nutritionist who has swapped caffeine for mushroom coffee and matcha tea. “When they first hit shelves, people were like, ‘Wait, we drink mushrooms now?’”\n“If you don’t like the taste or can’t find quality, organic mushrooms at your store, supplements are a great second option,” she adds. “Some people hate swallowing pills or are already taking too many, so mushroom powders are a great alternative because they're already broken down.”\nFor as long as humans have been getting sick, they have relied on fungi as a means of healing. Hippocrates is said to have used amadou, a spongy fungus, to reduce inflammation. Ötzi the Iceman had amadou in his supplies (probably for fire-starting), along with birch polypore, which was likely used to fight intestinal parasites. Native American cultures pressed puffball mushrooms onto wounds to halt bleeding and aid healing. Additionally, they used tiger milk mushrooms to treat asthma.\nEast Asian traditions have long used Phellinus fungi to treat digestive issues. Ganoderma lucidum—commonly known as reishi or lingzhi—was first recorded in the Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing, the oldest Chinese pharmacopeia, written over two millennia ago, where it was classified as a tonic for anti-aging and boosting qi. In modern-day China, reishi is often recommended to support immune function in patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation.\nInonotus obliquus—better known as chaga—has been a staple in traditional medicine among Indigenous communities across the world. Notably, native Siberians would grind up chaga and add it to teas, soups, and stews, believing it to ward off degenerative diseases. It was also a remedy for ulcers, liver ailments, and tuberculosis. Russian First Nations used it to slow the growth of visible tumors. Today, hunters in rural Russia still consume chaga to boost endurance on long treks.\nNutritionists agree: food first. Whole mushrooms (fruiting body, mycelium, and all) like maitake, shiitake, and lion’s mane offer fiber and nutrients you won’t get from mushroom blends. Toss them into stir-fries, omelets, or soups. While supplements don't always deliver the same results, here are some of the health benefits seen with regular intake.\nA review of 17 cancer studies shows that consuming about 1/8 cup of mushrooms a day may lower your risk of cancer by as much as 45 percent. Fungi are packed with ergothioneine, an amino acid and antioxidant that slows cellular damage. Shiitake, oyster, maitake, and king oyster have some of the higher amounts of ergothioneine, but any variety of mushrooms is better than none.\nIn a clinical trial in Singapore, participants who ate more than two cups of mushrooms (golden, oyster, shiitake, and white button) a week had a 50 percent lower risk of developing mild cognitive impairment.\nUnlike many foods that are broken down by stomach acid, the polysaccharides in fungi remain intact as they pass through the stomach. This allows them to reach the colon, where they can prompt the growth of healthy bacteria.\nCertain shrooms also provide vital nutrients that can support your overall well-being. Cremini and portobello are high in selenium, a mineral that produces antioxidant enzymes to prevent cell damage. Maitake mushrooms are a great source of vitamin D, and incorporate shiitake into your diet for vitamin B6.\nFrom nootropic lattes to adaptogenic powders, certain species have become stars in the wellness space. Here's what the research and experts have to say about the fungi dominating your feed.\nChaga, a white-rot fungus that thrives on birch trees in northern climates, is recognized for its abundant antioxidants. “If you have autoimmune issues like Hashimoto’s or psoriasis, Chaga mushrooms are awesome because they reduce inflammation,” says Zeitlin. Though much of the research has been conducted in vitro or on animals, Chaga demonstrates promising antimicrobial, anti-diabetic, and anti-inflammatory effects.\nCordyceps is a parasitic fungus that sprouts on larvae of insects. In wellness marketing, it's the performance mushroom and a favorite among athletes. Research suggests cordyceps may help improve stamina and post-workout recovery by boosting ATP production and oxygen efficiency in cells. But many of those claims are based on early-stage research and lab models.\nMarketed as brain superfood, lion’s mane mushroom is rich in terpenes like hericenones and erinacines that boost the production of nerve growth factor (NGF), a protein vital for the maintenance and regeneration of neurons. Preliminary research also indicates it may aid in nerve regeneration, reduce the risk of cognitive decline, and alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression. It’s important to note, though, since it might contain phytoestrogens that could activate estrogen-sensitive cells, those with a history of breast cancer should consult a physician before using it.\nMaitake (also known as hen-of-the-wood) contains beta-glucans that have been shown to activate lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and T-helper cells. Researchers are investigating its potential to help regulate blood pressure and blood sugar, particularly in individuals with metabolic issues. Zeitlin recommends maitake—and shiitake—mushrooms for those who have a history of chronic illnesses.\nReishi is studied for calming effects and possible support for blood sugar and lung function, thanks to its high polysaccharide content. “Reishi mushrooms are for a general wellness boost,” Zeitlin says. “If you're feeling stressed out, you get colds frequently, or it's spring season and your allergies are running amok, Reishi mushrooms are a supportive move.”\nBehind their umami-rich bite is a potent wellness profile: These mushrooms deliver lentinan, an immune-boosting polysaccharide, and eritadenine, known for supporting heart health by lowering cholesterol. Shiitake also reduces inflammation markers like CRP (C-reactive protein) and IgA (Immunoglobulin A). Plus, they’re packed with B vitamins to support energy, metabolism, and cardiovascular health.\nThis colorful mushroom gets its name from its resemblance to a turkey tail's feather, and it's one of the most researched macrofunguses in oncology. Turkey tail mushroom is rich in protein-bound polysaccharides that stimulate immune responses, particularly in the function of T-cells and NK cells.\nLike most supplements, timing your mushroom intake depends on the specific variety and what you're hoping to get out of it.\nLet's start with mornings. If you're caffeine-sensitive, mushrooms can be an energizing swap. Lion's mane is a go-to for morning focus (especially during workdays) for its ability to support your nervous system, and cordyceps is a popular pre-workout boost. “Caffeine works by blocking the neurotransmitters that make us feel tired,” says Zeitlin, who regularly drinks mushroom coffee. “It doesn’t give us energy, it just stops the sensation of tiredness.”\nChaga acts as a multitasker; it provides calmness without sedation, allowing it to enhance your morning coffee or offer an afternoon boost. Its earthy, mildly bitter taste has a coffee-like mouthfeel, contributing to its popularity. If you’re looking for immune support, incorporate turkey tail in the morning to prepare your body for a day of commuting. Finally, reishi is typically consumed in the evening to help relax the body.\nIn most cases, yes—consuming medicinal mushrooms poses minimal side effects for most people, unless you're allergic. Toss them into stir-fries, omelets, or soups.\nConcentrated mushroom extracts operate in murkier territory. Dietary supplements are under-regulated in the US, and that lack of oversight extends to functional fungi. The Food and Drug Administration doesn't require products to verify efficacy or safety, so labels may not always reflect what's inside the package. “If you’re going the supplement route, look for products with natural ingredients and some sort of third-party regulation,” says dietitian Laura Wargo. “That gives you a clearer idea of what’s actually in them.”\nBe sure to take them with food to avoid any gastrointestinal discomfort. “Natural food is more bioavailable, and taking supplements with a meal can support better digestion,” Wargo says.\nOm\nOm\nAmazon\nLaird Superfood\nAmazon\nSlumber\nSlumber\nAtlas Coffee Club\nAtlas Coffee Club\nPlant People\nPlant People\nAmazon\nLucid\nAmazon\nLucid\nWhat Are We Testing Next?\nI'll be testing Host Defense's Mushroom Capsules.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Learn more.\nLegalZoom is one of those online legal services that in most cases can handle basic legal tasks for you. I recently tried it out to make an LLC for my cosmic country band, Steel Fringe (shameless plug), and it appears to have worked just fine (we’re still waiting on a full evaluation from legal experts for a future guide to these services). If you use a LegalZoom promo code right now, you will get a discount on the service.\nI found it super easy to set up my LLC, and after about $500 and 30 minutes of my time, I was off to the races with an LLC for my band. I did make the mistake of spelling my co-bandleader’s middle name as his last name (I blame his wrongly named Instagram handle for this), so I had to toss them another $129 to fix that. My bad.\nSave on top services at LegalZoom, like LLC registration, incorporation, estate plans, and more with coupons and deals from WIRED below.\nIf you’re in need of basic legal services like establishing an LLC, estate planning, or other contract-based services, LegalZoom offers a very simple interface that is shockingly easy to use. I am a luddite when it comes to understanding legal jargon and steps in a process like establishing my band’s LLC, but LegalZoom’s simple interface made it shockingly easy to make sure everything was in order.\nIf you use our exclusive code for 10% off LLC Formations (found in the table above), you’ll get a nice chunk of change off the cost of setting up your small business. As you’ll read below, it’s not especially cheap to do this, even digitally, in many states. There are mandatory filing fees and other fees that can range from a few hundred to many hundreds of dollars. Take the discount!\nThe cost to properly set up an LLC in your state can range from $35 to $500, depending on various factors like local legislation and business registration laws. Most states charge between $50 and $200 for filing fees, so you can expect to pay somewhere in that range unless you’re from Montana ($35) or Massachusetts ($500). LegalZoom also shoves a bunch of options you probably don’t need in your face, so be sure to Google what you actually need in your state before paying extra money to … print all your documents and put them in a folder for you, or other such nonsense.\nOnce you have your membership, you can take advantage of the bevy of helpful content LegalZoom provides to make sure you're getting the most out of the money you’ve invested in the service. These articles are especially great resources that provide information about top of mind questions, like “What is a Durable Power of Attorney, and How does it Work?” and Should I Trademark My Business Name?\nIf you’re looking for a good deal on other services, LegalZoom frequently offers seasonal promotions, and nearly always celebrates Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the New Year with discounts for legal eagles.\nIf you have many or ongoing needs, you can choose an annual plan with LegalZoom where it will do all of your required legal filings, often offering lower monthly rates than paying month to month. There are also installment plan options for products priced at $200 or more, if you really need something done but can’t quite afford it right now."

    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/save-dollar100-or-more-on-a-mac-mini-today/",
    "content": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nIn the market for a new macOS-based desktop, but don't have a lot of space to spare? Amazon is currently offering discounts on both the 256-GB and 512-GB model of the late 2024 Apple Mac Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends) with the M4 chip.\nApple\nAmazon\nApple\nBest Buy\nApple's M4 CPU is at the heart of both versions of this miniaturized desktop, with 10 cores each for the CPU and GPU. Our reviewer Brenda Stolyar had no complaints about the performance, noting that it handled multiple browser tabs, chat programs, and other apps without lagging or slowing down. That's good news, because the memory isn't upgradeable by the user later.\nOf course the main selling point with the Mac Mini is its tiny footprint. This model has slimmed down from the previous generation's 2.6 pounds to just 1.5 pounds, and has only a 5 x 5-inch body. That's not just small enough to squeeze onto basically any desk or cabinet, but could even sneak into a bag if you need to take it with you to work or on a trip. The only real question mark here is the power button, which is mysteriously underneath the system, so you need to pick it up to turn it on.\nYou'll have to make some compromises when it comes to ports, but it's probably not nearly as bad as you're thinking. The front has two USB-C ports with USB 3.0 support, as well as a 3.5-mm headphone jack for easy access. Around back you'll find three Thunderbolt 4 ports, plus an HDMI connection for your monitor, Ethernet, and power, with USB-A now totally removed from the equation. If you leverage all the ports, you can connect up to three external displays, with support for resolutions up to 6K, depending on your configuration.\nThere are two discounted models, but there's really only a minor SSD storage size difference between the two. The 256-GB model is marked down from $599 to $499, and the 512-GB model is discounted from $799 to $689. We think either one is a great option for casual computer users looking for a lightweight and compact option, but make sure to check out our full roundup of the best Apple Desktop computers if you think an iMac might be more your speed."

    "title": "US Tech Giants Race to Spend Billions in UK AI Push",
    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-nvidia-uk-investment-trump/",
    "content": "Microsoft and Nvidia have unveiled plans to invest up to $45 billion dollars into the UK economy, in a move that will bolster the building of more data centers as well as research and development into artificial intelligence.\nThe investment comes as US president Donald Trump travels to Britain, where he is expected to announce a US-UK tech deal alongside UK prime minister Keir Starmer.\nAs part of the agreement, Microsoft has committed to invest $30 billion in AI infrastructure over the next four years. The company claims this is the largest financial commitment it has ever made in the UK and will make up more than two thirds of the total investment announced into the UK this week, timed to Trump’s visit.\n“We are focused on British pounds, not empty tech promises,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s vice chair and president, told journalists in a virtual briefing ahead of the announcement today. “We will be good for every cent of this investment.” Half of the money will go to capital expansion— “all new money, all new investments,” Smith claimed—whereas the other half will go to efforts like a partnership with the data center business Nscale, to finance and use its facilities.\nNvidia, for its part, has pledged to spend up to $15 billion on AI-related R&D efforts in the UK. The chipmaker will not invest directly into building out the infrastructure, instead acting through its partners CoreWeave and Nscale.\nThis announcement comes alongside a new joint venture from Nvidia, Nscale, and OpenAI today, which plans to “strengthen the UK’s sovereign compute capabilities” through an AI infrastructure partnership called Stargate UK. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang traveled with Trump to the UK during his state visit this week.\n“Stargate UK ensures OpenAI’s world-leading AI models can run on local computing power in the UK, for the UK,” said OpenAI in a statement. OpenAI will provide up to 8,000 GPUs in the first quarter of 2026 with the potential to scale to 31,000 GPUs over time. As part of the agreement, OpenAI says Nscale is set to significantly expand its capacity across a number of sites in the UK, including Cobalt Park in Newcastle, which will be part of a newly designated AI Growth Zone in the northeast.\n“This historic commitment from Nscale shows how the UK can build the future of AI, together with our partners from the US,” Nscale CEO Josh Payne said in a statement. “It’s only by building world-class AI infrastructure that we will stay competitive in the global race.”\nWhen asked to characterize Microsoft’s relationship with Nscale, Smith said simply, “We write the check, and they spend the money.”\nSmith was quick to claim that the company did not get a request from the Trump administration to make an investment announcement. “We have had many conversations with the UK government, including with folks at Number 10, as you would expect, and those have been going on for months,” he said.\nUK prime minister Keir Starmer said that he wants the UK to be the “destination of choice for companies at the forefront of technological change,” according to a joint press release issued Tuesday by Nscale. The announcements this week are part of a plan to harness homegrown talent and ensure that the UK can compete on artificial intelligence. He labeled these deals as a “decisive step” toward achieving that goal.\nJust before Trump’s visit on Tuesday, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, announced a $6.8 billion investment in UK artificial intelligence efforts over the next two years. This will include funding for Google DeepMind, according to an interview the company did with BBC News. The company today also opened a $1 billion data center in the English county of Hertfordshire.\nLondon, which is still Europe’s largest data center market, has been impacted by constraints in power availability and the lack of suitable land, according to data from real estate services firm CBRE.\nThe UK government deemed data centers critical national infrastructure in September 2024. However, opposition is brewing across the country as environmental, advocacy, and local residents groups complain about the environmental impact of power-hungry data centers.\nTech justice group Foxglove has called for an urgent review into the UK’s strategy on developing new data centers. “Following the queasy spectacle of CEOs from tech giants like Google, Meta and OpenAI queuing up to pay tribute at the White House this month, it’s little surprise to hear that the Trump-Big Tech axis is dead set on covering the UK in hyperscale data centres,” Campbell said in a written statement to WIRED. “Meanwhile, the UK will foot the bill for the colossal amounts of power the giants need—meaning sky-rocketing prices for households—as well as the water needed to keep them cool.”\nGlobal Action Plan argues that the government has ignored the vast water and power consumption of hyperscale data centers, which are massive, highly automated data centers used for large-scale data processing, storage, and computing.\n“More and bigger data centers mean more electricity demand and more pressure on water supplies,” says Oliver Hayes, head of policy and campaigns at Global Action Plan. “There will be a very significant impact on additional power demand. It will make it harder to reach our climate goals. It’s a trade-off, and at the moment they are not being held accountable for that trade-off.”"

    "title": "OpenAI's Teen Safety Features Will Walk a Thin Line",
    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/openai-launches-teen-safety-features/",
    "content": "OpenAI announced new teen safety features for ChatGPT on Tuesday as part of an ongoing effort to respond to concerns about how minors engage with chatbots. The company is building an age-prediction system that identifies if a user is under 18 years old and routes them to an “age-appropriate” system that blocks graphic sexual content. If the system detects that the user is considering suicide or self-harm, it will contact the user’s parents. In cases of imminent danger, if a user's parents are unreachable, the system may contact the authorities.\nIn a blog post about the announcement, CEO Sam Altman wrote that the company is attempting to balance freedom, privacy, and teen safety.\n“We realize that these principles are in conflict, and not everyone will agree with how we are resolving that conflict,” Altman wrote. “These are difficult decisions, but after talking with experts, this is what we think is best and want to be transparent in our intentions.”\nWhile OpenAI tends to prioritize privacy and freedom for adult users, for teens the company says it puts safety first. By the end of September, the company will roll out parental controls so that parents can link their child’s account to their own, allowing them to manage the conversations and disable features. Parents can also receive notifications when “the system detects their teen is in a moment of acute distress,” according to the company’s blog post, and set limits on the times of day their children can use ChatGPT.\nThe moves come as deeply troubling headlines continue to surface about people dying by suicide or committing violence against family members after engaging in lengthy conversations with AI chatbots. Lawmakers have taken notice, and both Meta and OpenAI are under scrutiny. Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission asked Meta, OpenAI, Google, and other AI firms to hand over information about how their technologies impact kids, according to Bloomberg.\nAt the same time, OpenAI is still under a court order mandating that it preserve consumer chats indefinitely—a fact that the company is extremely unhappy about, according to sources I’ve spoken to. Today’s news is both an important step toward protecting minors and a savvy PR move to reinforce the idea that conversations with chatbots are so personal that consumer privacy should only be breached in the most extreme circumstances.\nFrom the sources I’ve spoken to at OpenAI, the burden of protecting users weighs heavily on many researchers. They want to create a user experience that is fun and engaging, but it can quickly veer into becoming disastrously sycophantic. It's positive that companies like OpenAI are taking steps to protect minors. At the same time, in the absence of federal regulation, there's still nothing forcing these firms to do the right thing.\nIn a recent interview, Tucker Carlson pushed Altman to answer exactly who is making these decisions that impact the rest of us. The OpenAI chief pointed to the model behavior team, which is responsible for tuning the model for certain attributes. “The person I think you should hold accountable for those calls is me,” Altman added. “Like, I’m a public face. Eventually, like, I’m the one that can overrule one of those decisions or our board.”\nHe’s right, yet some of the imminent harms seem to escape him. In another podcast interview with YouTuber Cleo Abrams, Altman said that “sometimes we do get tempted” to launch products “that would really juice growth.” He added: “We haven’t put a sexbot avatar in ChatGPT yet.” Yet! How strange.\nOpenAI recently released research on who uses ChatGPT, and how they use it. That research excluded users who were under the age of 18. We don’t yet have a full understanding of how teens are using AI, and it’s an important question to answer before the situation grows more dire.\nElon Musk’s xAI is suing a former staffer who left the company to join OpenAI, alleging in a complaint that he misappropriated trade secrets and confidential information. In the current era of AI companies swapping staffers for multimillion-dollar compensation packages, I’m sure we’ll see more of these types of lawsuits pop up.\nThe staffer in question, Xuechen Li, never made it to OpenAI’s internal Slack, according to two sources at the company. It’s unclear whether his offer was rescinded, or if he was onboarded only to be let go. OpenAI and Li did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment.\nThis is an edition of Kylie Robison’s Model Behavior newsletter. Read previous newsletters here."

    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/best-tv-shows-hulu-this-week/",
    "content": "While Netflix seemingly led the way for other streaming networks to create compelling original programming, Hulu actually beat them all to the punch. In 2011, a year before Netflix’s Lilyhammer and two years before the arrival of House of Cards, the burgeoning streamer premiered The Morning After, a pop-culture-focused news show that ran for 800 episodes over three years.\nHulu has continued to make TV history in the years since, most notably in 2017 when it became the first streamer to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series with The Handmaid’s Tale (which recently dropped its long-awaited final season). In the years since, the streamer has continued to match—and often exceed—that high bar for quality entertainment with shows like The Bear and Shōgun, which set an Emmy record in 2024 with 18 wins in a single season, and The Bear.\nWhile more competition has popped up since Hulu started gaining critical credibility, the network has continued to stand out for its carefully curated selection of original series and network partnerships that make it the home of FX series and more. Below are some of our favorite shows streaming on Hulu right now.\nNot finding what you’re looking for?

From the very beginning of their odd alliance, it’s been clear that all is not what it seems, and everyone is keeping secrets. The show has also managed to attract an increasingly stellar list of guest stars, some of them recurring characters, that includes Meryl Streep, Paul Rudd, Eugene Levy, Kumail Nanjiani, Tina Fey, Melissa McCarthy, Zach Galifianakis, Sting, Nathan Lane, and Jane Lynch. Season 5, which contains some fun nods to The Godfather, kicked off on September 9 and features Bobby Cannavale, Renée Zellweger, Christoph Waltz, Keegan-Michael Key, Téa Leoni, Logan Lerman, Beanie Feldstein, Dianne Wiest, and Richard Kind.\nThis action-filled spy drama from South Korea is a thrilling—and timely—tale of global corruption at the highest levels. Jang Jun-ik (Park Hae-joon) is a presidential candidate who dreams of bringing peace to his people—a notion that doesn’t sit well with everyone. When he is assassinated just feet from his wife, Seo Mun-ju (Jun Ji-hyun), a former ambassador, she vows to get to the truth behind her husband’s murder. What she discovers is a chilling conspiracy that threatens world peace and leads all the way to the White House. Good thing she’s got mercenary Baek San-ho (Gang Dong-won) by her side.\nIn September 2007, Amanda Knox was just another American college student opting to study abroad for a year. Just weeks later, she was on the front page of newspapers around the world following the brutal murder of her roommate, Meredith Kercher, which Knox was eventually arrested for. Nearly 20 years—and one controversial murder conviction—later, Knox is reclaiming her own narrative to tell her version of events in this new Hulu series, which is based on Knox’s own memoir and executive produced by Knox and Monica Lewinsky. Though the series’ campiness doesn’t always land, given the subject matter, star Grace Van Patten’s impressive performance helps to ground the story.\nWith Fargo, Noah Hawley proved that he could transform an iconic movie into a compelling TV series. Now he’s done it again with Alien: Earth, a prequel series that takes place just two years before the events of Ridley Scott’s original Alien movie. The series revolves around the Prodigy Corporation, a tech company that has come up with a way to transfer the consciousness of terminally ill children into the bodies of synthetic beings. Wendy (Sydney Chandler) is one of these “hybrids,” whose memory of her past turns out to be a complication, especially when she volunteers herself and her fellow hybrids to investigate the mysterious crash of a Weyland-Yutani research spacecraft, which houses all sorts of horrors—and creatures.\nFifteen years after saying goodbye, Mike Judge and Greg Daniels’ beloved animated series is taking viewers back to Arlen, Texas, home of propane salesman Hank Hill (Judge), his wife Peggy (Kathy Najimy), and their son Bobby (Pamela Adlon). Hank and Peggy have been away for a while, living in Saudi Arabia while Hank saves for their retirement. But their return home is bittersweet, for as much as Arlen has remained the same, the world around them has changed.\nThough it’s not based on a true story, Dope Girls is inspired by a nonfiction book, Marek Cohen’s Dope Girls: The Birth of the British Drug Underground, and a very real part of British history. In the wake of World War I, Kate Galloway (Julianne Nicholson) is a widow and mom who needs to provide for her family. She ends up building one of London’s most popular underground nightclubs, and a drug empire that would make Walter White blush.\nEsi Edugyan’s 2018 best-selling historical fiction novel gets the miniseries treatment via Hulu. Eleven-year-old George Washington “Wash” Black (Ernest Kingsley Jr.) flees from his native Barbados to Nova Scotia following a tragic incident at the plantation where he was enslaved. Once free, Wash meets Medwin Harris (Sterling K. Brown), who is impressed with Wash’s intelligence and determination, and sees a lot of himself in the youngster. So he takes him under his wing in order to help him make the most of the second chance at life he has been given.\nCarmen “Carmy” Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) is a superstar of the fine-dining world who has returned to his hometown of Chicago to save his family’s failing sandwich shop after his brother’s death by suicide. While Carmy initially struggles to acclimate himself to being home and to his inherited kitchen’s back-to-basics style, he eventually realizes that it’s not too late to change both himself and the restaurant. Anyone who has ever worked in a busy kitchen knows the stress that comes with it, and The Bear does an excellent job of making that tension palpable. While the plot sounds simple enough, much of Carmy’s previous life is a bit of a mystery, and it’s doled out in amuse-bouche-sized bits throughout the series with top-tier guest stars you may not have seen coming. (Fact: Jamie Lee Curtis has never been better, as evidenced by her very first Emmy win in 2024.) The Bear’s fourth season answers viewers’ pressing questions about Carmy’s partnership with Syd (Ayo Edebiri) and what the future holds for their restaurant. Prepare to feast.\nComedian/actress Kat Sadler created and stars in this deeply messy, darkly funny story of a totally dysfunctional family—mom Deb (Sherlock’s Louise Brealey) and daughters Josie (Sadler) and Billie (Lizzie Davidson, Sadler’s real-life sister)—attempting to pick up the pieces after their husband/father leaves them. It’s cringe-comedy at its finest, and the kind that will appeal to fans of Fleabag. The series’ second season arrived in July.\nThough many have dubbed Adults a Gen Z version of Friends, the similarities begin and end with the fact that it’s about a group of twentysomething pals trying to find themselves in New York City. When Samir’s (Malik Elassal) parents take off traveling, he invites a few of his pals—Anton (Owen Thiele), Billie (Lucy Freyer), and Issa (Amita Rao)—to come crash with him at his childhood home in Queens. While they all see it as a chance to supercharge their jump into adulthood, complete with hosting dinner parties, they soon realize they’re each in over their heads in their own ways when it comes to taking on the responsibilities that come with being a part of the real world.\nIn 2020, actor pals Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney (now legally known simply as “Rob Mac”) decided to take their friendship to the next level—by purchasing Wales’ Wrexham AFC, one of the world’s oldest football (aka soccer) clubs, which had long been struggling and was on the verge of possibly disappearing altogether. Enter the two Hollywood stars and their dreams of bringing the club back to its former glory. Like a real-life Ted Lasso, this docuseries follows the two as they begin to understand that what might have started as a lark is a literally game-changing turn for the players and people of Wrexham in reclaiming their storied sporting history. All four seasons of the series are streaming, with a fifth in the works.\nWhen Margaret Atwood wrote The Handmaid’s Tale in 1985, little did she know that its television adaptation would revolutionize the still-nascent world of original streaming content. And she may not have anticipated just how many parallels her dystopian classic would share with the real world at the time it was adapted into an award-winning television series. It’s set in an unnamed time in what is presumably the very near future, when the United States has been taken over by a fundamentalist group known as Gilead, under whose regime women are considered property and stripped of any personal rights. The most valuable women are those who are fertile, as infertility has become an epidemic, and they are kept as handmaids who are forced to take part in sexual rituals with high-ranking couples in order to bear their children. Recognizing the power she wields, Offred, aka June Osborne (Elisabeth Moss), is not content to remain enslaved and sets about changing the rules as she seeks to reunite with her lost husband and daughter, becoming romantically entangled with a Gilead Guardian (Max Minghella) in the process. The Handmaid’s Tale's sixth, and final, season is streaming in full now.\nFive-time Oscar nominee Michelle Williams plays Molly Kochan, a young woman trapped in a loveless marriage who learns that she has terminal stage IV breast cancer. After revealing that she has never had an orgasm with another person, it becomes apparent to Molly and everyone caring for her that this should be at the top of her bucket list. Realizing she doesn’t have much time left, Molly leaves her husband and, with the help of her best friend Nikki (Jenny Slate), sets out to achieve the sexual satisfaction that has eluded her all her life—with unexpected consequences. New Girl creator ​​Liz Meriwether teamed up with Kim Rosenstock (Only Murders in the Building) to create this hit new series, which is based on the life of the real Molly Kochan, creator of the Dying for Sex podcast, which launched in 2020.\nIf you thought the characters on Seinfeld were terrible people, wait until you meet the gang from Paddy’s Pub. For 20 years, Dennis (Glenn Howerton), Mac (Robert “Rob Mac” McElhenney), Charlie (Charlie Day), Sweet Dee (Kaitlin Olson), and Frank (Danny DeVito) have unapologetically plotted against each other and total strangers in a series of completely self-centered schemes with absolutely no regard for the rules of civility. The show follows the “no hugging and no learning” rule Larry David established for Seinfeld, but elevates it to a new level of sociopathy. “Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare,” “Sweet Dee Has a Heart Attack,” “How Mac Got Fat,” “Dennis Looks Like a Registered Sex Offender,” “The Gang Turns Black,” and “The Gang Goes to a Water Park” are just some of the offbeat adventures awaiting viewers. In 2021, Sunny became the longest-running live-action sitcom in the history of television, and it shows no signs of slowing down—or taking it easy on its characters. It also happens to be one of the easiest shows to binge: Pop an episode on and, without even realizing it, you’ll be on to another season. Its 17th (!!) season wrapped in August with at least one more already confirmed.\nCreator Jack Rooke won a well-deserved BAFTA Award in 2024 for this semi-autobiographical dramedy about a closeted 19-year-old—also named Jack (Dylan Llewellyn)—who, after a year of mourning the death of his father at home with his overprotective mom, leaves for university. There, he’s paired up with Danny (Jon Pointing), a 25-year-old more interested in meeting women than studying, as his roommate. As Jack struggles to become comfortable with his sexuality, he also comes to understand the truth behind Danny’s seemingly extroverted personality. Yes, it’s a coming-of-age story and one in which opposites attract (on a purely platonic level). But it’s also a laugh-out-loud funny series that shows there is life after death.\nPakistani American brothers Mir (Asif Ali) and Raj (Saagar Shaikh) Dar have spent their entire lives wanting for nothing, thanks to the hard work of their father, who owns a chain of convenience stores. But after a freak accident kills dear old dad, the brothers are expected to take on the family business which, unbeknownst to them, is actually a front for a drug smuggling empire. While their antics are undoubtedly hilarious, the series does attempt to paint a truthful portrait of the immigrant experience—even if it’s often through an absurdist lens. In late August, almost six months after the series premiered, Hulu finally confirmed that a second season is on its way, with former SNL star Fred Armisen joining the cast.\nIf Netflix’s Emmy juggernaut Adolescence has you seeking out more of Stephen Graham’s work, check out Steven Knight’s A Thousand Blows—the Peaky Blinders creator’s newest British historical drama in which crime and violence collide. In this case it’s an all-female crime syndicate, the Forty Elephants, who are at the center of the action, with Mary Carr (Erin Doherty) as their leader. When Mary’s crew crosses notorious kingpin Sugar Goodson (Graham), she turns to Hezekiah Moscow (Malachi Kirby) and Alec Munroe (Francis Lovehall), two young men who have recently emigrated from Jamaica in order to make a better life for themselves, to help her escape Goodson’s wrath.\nThis Is Us creator Dan Fogelman reteams with that award-winning series’ star, Sterling K. Brown, for an intricate political thriller which plays with time to slowly reveal the details of a secret service agent (Brown) tasked with protecting the president (James Marsden) who ultimately becomes a suspect in the POTUS’ death. Expect many twists—including a massive one to kick off the series in episode 1. A second season is already in the works and will add Shailene Woodley, Thomas Doherty, Michael McGrady, and Timothy Omundson to the cast. It is expected to premiere in early 2026.\n“Why would somebody fake cancer?” That’s the question asked—and that ABC News attempts to answer—in this true crime docuseries based on the podcast of the same name. The four-part special recounts the life and lies of Amanda C. Riley, a wife, mother, churchgoer, and popular mommy blogger who was celebrated for sharing her fight against Hodgkin’s lymphoma with the world … only to have it all blow up in her face.\nLike a reverse engineered version of Law & Order, Accused—adapted by Homeland cocreator Howard Gordon from the acclaimed British series of the same name—follows the justice system from the perspective of the accused. Each episode begins with the defendant in the courtroom and recounts (via flashbacks) the circumstances that led them there. Like Dick Wolf’s iconic crime series, each episode is full of familiar faces, from Whitney Cummings and Wendell Pierce to Molly Parker and Margo Martindale.\nFact and fiction combine in this historical drama based on Patrick Radden Keefe’s novel that follows the lives of a group of people growing up in Belfast during the Troubles and their dealings with the Provisional IRA. Much of the story focuses on the Disappeared—a group of 16 people who went missing during the Troubles and were believed to have been kidnapped and murdered. Jean McConville was one of these individuals, both the only woman among them and the only Irish Catholic convert. Nearly 50 years later, many questions remain about these individuals. While Say Nothing doesn’t attempt to answer all of these questions, it does add fascinating context to the events.\nWillis Wu (Jimmy O. Yang) is a waiter who attempts to escape his humdrum life by imagining that he is a background actor in a Law & Order-esque TV show called Black & White. After Wu witnesses a kidnapping, police detective Lana Lee (Chloe Bennet) enlists him to help investigate and take down the local gangs in Chinatown—where he discovers something about his own family in the process. Nothing is what it seems in this meta comedy-crime series, which Charles Yu adapted from his own National Book Award–winning novel. The Daily Show’s Ronny Chieng ups the comedy as Wu’s coworker/BFF Fatty Choi, and Taika Waititi (one of the show’s executive producers) directs the pilot.\nIf you are in need of a laugh-out-loud comedy (and don’t mind if it’s of the sometimes R-rated kind), there are few better than What We Do in the Shadows. In 2014, Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi cowrote, codirected, and costarred in a feature of the same name—a funny mockumentary featuring a group of vampires who share a home. This series, which premiered in 2019, moved the vampire action from New Zealand to Staten Island and brought in a whole new group of vampires—who struggle to even get up off the couch, let alone take over all of New York City (as they’ve been instructed to). After several years, they finally seem ready to get around to the task. All six seasons of the series, which wrapped up its run in late 2024, are available for streaming.\nGael García Bernal and Diego Luna have been close friends since childhood, and it shows in the work they’ve done together—most famously in Alfonso Cuarón’s Oscar-nominated Y Tu Mamá También (2001). More than two decades later, their onscreen chemistry is still potent, as evidenced by this Spanish-language boxing drama. Esteban (Bernal) is an aging boxer whose manager/BFF Andy (Luna) persuades him to step into the ring one last time before he officially retires. But as the match looms closer, the criminal underbelly of the sport rears its head—forcing Esteban to determine what parts of his life he’s willing to sacrifice. With just six episodes in all, La Máquina moves fast. Don’t flinch.\nFormer Saturday Night Live and Insecure writer Natasha Rothwell—whom you might know from her Emmy-nominated turn as spa manager Belinda in seasons 1 and 3 of The White Lotus—created and stars in this eight-episode series. Mel (Rothwell) is an employee at New York City’s JFK Airport who is content with the uneventful life she has built for herself. But when she has a sudden brush with death, she decides to take her life into her own hands. While it’s not the first series to explore matters of life and death, it does so in a way that is both beautifully nuanced and laugh-out-loud funny—all of it anchored by Rothwell’s performance. On February 4, Hulu announced that it had canceled the series after one season—a move that has Rothwell “baffled” and looking for a new network to produce season 2.\nTelevision audiences are hardly lacking in high school–set comedies, or in really great high school–set comedies, and/or really great high school–set comedies that focus on the teacher perspective (see: Abbott Elementary). English Teacher fits into that elite niche. Brian Jordan Alvarez—who was behind the award-winning 2016 web series The Gay and Wondrous Life of Caleb Gallo—both created and stars in the show, in which he portrays an English teacher in Austin, Texas, who is dedicated to making an impact on his students, even if he sometimes needs to depend on their teenage wisdom to figure out the right way to do that. While it doesn’t shy away from the politics that exist in the teaching profession, the series also presents the “adults” as often just as lost as the kids they teach. The first three episodes of English Teacher’s second season arrive on September 25.\nThis animated sci-fi comedy, which premiered in 2020, is about a family of aliens from the planet Shlorp who crash-land on Earth—for better or worse. The show is rooted in the idea that humans are, well, weird. Which seems appropriate given this current moment in time. Yet, in between the laughs and occasional threat to humanity, it maintains a positive outlook on the world and the people who inhabit it. Which is something we could probably all use right about now. The show’s sixth season, which arrives on October 13, will also be its last.\nFollowing a decade-long hiatus, Futurama—Matt Groening and David X. Cohen’s animated sci-fi comedy—made a triumphant return in 2023, complete with gags about Twilight Zone and “Momazon” drone deliveries. The show’s all-new 13th season arrived on September 15, with all 10 episodes dropping at once versus weekly, as has been the case in the past. And one more season has already been confirmed, making now the perfect time to dive back in—or watch it all for the first time.\nIn Radom, Poland, the Kurcs are a loving family who seem to have it all—until the horrors of the Holocaust invade the serenity of their everyday lives. As World War II arrives on their doorstep, the family is separated—escaping to France, Brazil, West Africa, and Russia. Some are in hiding, others in concentration camps. But they’re all focused on one goal: surviving the war and reuniting with each other.\nQueenie Jenkins (Dionne Brown) is a Jamaican-British twentysomething whose world is thrown into an upheaval following an ugly breakup with her boyfriend. That messiness follows Queenie into the next chapter in her life, when she attempts to pick up the pieces of her failed relationship while frequently butting heads with her family and trying to reconcile her dual cultures. Candice Carty-Williams adapts her own bestselling novel to create a poignant dramedy that’s ultimately about trauma and healing.\nIn the late 2000s—back when Elon Musk was just that car-and-spaceship billionaire—Twitter was more than a social media network. It was a genuine gathering place for people to find their people, whether that was Film Twitter or Cat Twitter. For Black Twitter, it was a lot more. This three-part docuseries, based on WIRED senior writer Jason Parham’s 2021 cover story, recounts the most important moments and movements that helped solidify the Black Twitter community’s place as a cultural force in the world, from politics and beyond.\nRiley Keough and Lily Gladstone (who earned an Emmy nomination for her work in the show) make a formidable duo as an author and a police officer, respectively, investigating the brutal murder of a 14-year-old girl in a small town in Canada. The limited series is based on Rebecca Godfrey’s award-winning 2005 book of the same name (with Keough portraying Godfrey), and is a haunting reminder of what human beings are capable of.\nGame of Thrones fans still lamenting the loss of one of television's great epics have found their new favorite binge-watch in Shōgun, which took home a record 18 Emmys (with 25 nods altogether) in 2024. This 10-episode series, based on James Clavell’s beloved novel (which was first adapted into a miniseries in 1980), is a brilliant and sweeping tale of political rivalry in feudal Japan where Lord Yoshii Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada), a powerful warrior, has a target put on his back by his political rivals in the Council of Regents. Fortunately for Toranaga, he’s got Toda Mariko (Anna Sawai), a talented translator and fiercely loyal samurai, by his side. Shōgun was originally positioned as a one-and-done limited series, but FX and Hulu have already confirmed that two more seasons are in the works, with the next expected to arrive in 2027.\nQuinta Brunson created and stars in this hit series, which follows the daily lives—in and out of the classroom—of a group of teachers at what is widely considered one of the worst public schools in America. Despite a lack of funding for even basic educational necessities, and school district leaders who only care about the barest minimum standards, these educators are united by their drive to surpass expectations and encourage their students to do the same.\nNoah Hawley’s anthology series isn’t the first attempt to adapt the Coen brothers’ Oscar-winning crime-comedy to the small screen (Edie Falco starred in a previous version, which was a more straightforward adaptation of the movie), but his approach was clearly the smarter move. Fans of the Coens in general will find lots to love about the many nods to the filmmakers’ entire filmography, with each season covering a different crime and time period. Though the seasons do share connections, each one is a total one-off, and the show might boast the most talented group of actors ever assembled: Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman, Bob Odenkirk, Oliver Platt, Ted Danson, Patrick Wilson, Nick Offerman, Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Plemons, Ewan McGregor, Michael Stuhlbarg, Carrie Coon, Scoot McNairy, Chris Rock, Jason Schwartzman, Timothy Olyphant, and Ben Whishaw are just a few of the names who’ve found a home in Fargo. The fantastic fifth season—featuring Juno Temple, Jon Hamm, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Joe Keery, and Lamorne Morris (who won an Emmy for his role)—continued this tradition of exceptional acting, with all episodes streaming now.\nDarby Hart (Emma Corrin) is a talented hacker and armchair detective who is one of eight guests invited to spend a few days at the stunning yet remote home of a mysterious billionaire (Clive Owen). When one of the guests ends up dead, Darby must work quickly to prove that it was murder—and who did it—before the bodies start piling up. Fans of twisty true crime will appreciate this limited series, which comes from the minds of Brit Marling (who costars) and Zal Batmanglij—cocreators of the equally mind-bending The OA.\nSinclair Daniel shines as Nella Rogers, an up-and-coming book editor—and the only Black employee at the publishing house where she works. While Nella is initially thrilled when another young woman of color, Hazel-May McCall (Ashleigh Murray), is hired as an assistant, she can’t help but notice that a series of bizarre events seems to follow. As Nella tries to suss out exactly what is going on, she uncovers some pretty damn disturbing skeletons in her employer’s closet. While horror-comedies are an increasingly popular movie genre, we don’t see them on the small screen quite as often—which, if this clever series is any indication, is a real shame. Also unfortunate: One season is all we’ll get of The Other Black Girl.\nTwenty-six years after a low-budget British comedy blew up at the box office, scored an Oscar, and introduced “the Full Monty” into the popular lexicon, the Regular Joes turned strippers from Sheffield are back to face largely the same issues they were lamenting in the original feature film (which is also streaming on Hulu). Much of the main cast reassembled for this follow-up to Peter Cattaneo’s hit 1997 movie, including two-time Oscar nominee Tom Wilkinson, who passed away in late December. Stripping is involved, as are other inevitables in life, including breakups, reconciliations, and death. For fans of the original movie—or the Broadway musical and stage play that followed—it’s a fun check-in with the characters who bared it all.\nYears before there was Jim and Pam and Dwight and Michael, there were Tim and Dawn and Gareth and David. For lovers of cringe, it’s hard to do better than Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant’s workplace comedy. David Brent (Gervais) is the original boss from hell, whose office antics will have you covering your eyes and laughing out loud at the same time. Like many British series, there are just two seasons—each consisting of a mere six episodes—plus a two-part Christmas special. Don’t be surprised if you sit down to watch a single episode and binge it all in one go.\nIn the 1980s, NBC was the channel to watch on Thursday nights—in large part thanks to Cheers. The bar where everybody knows your name is where the action happens in this award-winning sitcom about a former Red Sox player (Ted Danson) and the lovable employees and patrons who treat his bar like a second home. If you can look past (or, even better, embrace) the questionable ’80s fashion and sometimes-sexist storylines that wouldn’t necessarily fly on TV today, you’ll find what is arguably one of the smartest sitcoms ever written. More than 40 years after its original premiere, the jokes still stand up and the characters are some of television’s most memorable (and beloved) for a reason.\nBack in 2021, Hulu went where Netflix’s Painkiller went in 2023: to the late ’90s and early 2000s, aka the beginning of America’s opioid crisis. Danny Strong created this retelling of the lengths to which Richard Sackler (played here by the always excellent Michael Stuhlbarg) and Purdue Pharma would go to sell doctors on the powers of OxyContin—all with the promise of no addiction. Michael Keaton won an Emmy for his portrayal of a widowed doctor in Appalachia who buys into the lies, and eventually becomes a victim of them.\nTaika Waititi and Sterlin Harjo cocreated this Peabody Award–winning series, which made history as the first mainstream TV show created by, starring, and crewed by an almost entirely Indigenous American team. It tells the story of four bored teens who are desperate to escape their lives on a reservation in Oklahoma. They decide that California is where they want to be and commit to a life of mostly petty crimes in order to save up enough money to leave. The full three seasons are available to watch now, including the brilliant series sendoff.\nElle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult shine in this witty, fast-paced, comedic retelling (but not really) of Catherine the Great’s rise to power. Created by Tony McNamara, who earned Oscar nominations for his writing work on both The Favourite and Poor Things, The Great offers the same combination of lush costumes and scenery mixed with a biting commentary on the world, and a woman’s place in it. A story that rings as true today as it did in the 18th century, when Catherine the Great became empress of Russia and brought about the Age of Enlightenment, this show chips away at notions of class, propriety, and monarchical rule in a way few others do. If it’s historical accuracy you’re after, look elsewhere; the series’ creators describe it as decidedly “anti-historical” (which is part of the fun). All three seasons are available to stream.\nThe reason to watch this eight-part limited series can be summed up in two words: Kathryn Hahn. A comedic juggernaut, Hahn can switch from funny to dramatic in the same scene, if not the same sentence. This talent is on display in Tiny Beautiful Things, where she plays Claire, a writer who takes up an advice column and pours all the traumas of her life into responding to her readers. Based on Wild author Cheryl Strayed’s collection of “Dear Sugar” columns, the vignettes here may be a bit out of sorts, but Hahn pulls them together.\nDave Burd is a comedian and rapper who goes by the stage name Lil Dicky. In Dave, Burd plays a rapper who goes by the stage name Lil Dicky and is attempting to raise his profile and make a much bigger name for himself. If only his many neuroses didn’t keep getting in the way. While Dave could have easily turned into some mediocre experiment in meta storytelling, Burd—who cocreated the series, stars in it, and has written several episodes—grapples with some surprisingly touchy topics, including mental illness. And he does it all with a level of sensitivity and honesty that you might not expect from a guy named Lil Dicky. Despite the show’s popularity and critical acclaim, the three seasons currently streaming may be all we get of Dave. In early 2024, Burd announced that he’d be pressing “pause” on the series in order to explore other creative ventures. (But never say never.)\nDonald Glover proved himself to be a quadruple threat of an actor, writer, musician, and comedian with this highly acclaimed FX series about Earnest “Earn” Marks (Glover), an aspiring music manager who is trying to help his cousin Alfred Miles, aka Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry), kick off his musical career. They’re surrounded by a supportive crew of friends, including Alfred’s BFF, Darius (LaKeith Stanfield), and Van (Zazie Beetz), Earn’s close friend and the mother of his child. This makes it all sound like a fairly straightforward buddy comedy, but Atlanta is so much more. Even better: It’s weird. Glover is not afraid to experiment with storytelling, which is part of what makes the show so compelling.\nZach Galifianakis stars alongside Zach Galifianakis as twin brothers Chip and Dale Baskets in this unexpectedly moving family comedy about an aspiring clown (Chip) who fails to graduate from a fancy clowning school in Paris and is forced to return home to Bakersfield, California, where he lives with his mother (the late Louie Anderson) and is constantly belittled by his higher-achieving brother (Dale). Between the dual role for Galifianakis and Anderson as the mom, it may sound like a cheap bit of stunt casting that can’t sustain more than an episode, let alone multiple character arcs. But if you’re a fan of absurdist comedy, Baskets truly ranks among the best of them. And Anderson, who won his first and only Emmy for his role as Costco-loving Christine, is absolutely transcendent. While it received a fair amount of critical acclaim, Baskets could rightly be considered one of the most underseen and underappreciated series in recent memory.\nAmanda Seyfried won a much deserved Outstanding Lead Actress Emmy for her portrayal of the notorious Stanford dropout turned health care technology maven Elizabeth Holmes, who tricked some of the world’s savviest business minds into investing in her company, Theranos. While Holmes’ goal was altruistic enough—making health care more accessible to the masses via a device that could detect any number of diseases with little more than a single finger prick of blood—the technology wasn’t able to catch up. Rather than admit defeat, she kept pushing, making business deals and promises she could never fulfill.\nWhat began as a web series is now a Hulu original that wrapped up its eleventh season in December. The show is a portrait of small-town Canada (the fictional Letterkenny of the title) and focuses on siblings Wayne (cocreator Jared Keeso) and Katy (Michelle Mylett), who run a produce stand with help from friends Daryl (Nathan Dales) and Squirrely Dan (K. Trevor Wilson). As is often the case in small-town series, many of the residents fall into specific categories—in Letterkenny, you could be a gym rat, a hick, a skid (their word for a drug addict), or a “native” (a member of the nearby First Nation reservation). But in contrast to many small-town series, these groups—and the individuals who comprise them—aren’t reduced to meaningless stereotypes.\nMining the awkwardness of one’s middle school years is hardly a new comedy concept. But being in your early thirties and playing yourself as a junior high school student and then surrounding yourself with age-appropriate actors who are actually going through that hellish rite of passage brings a whole new layer of cringe and humor. This is exactly what cocreators/stars Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle did for Pen15."

    "title": "Charlie Kirk Shooting Suspect Charged as Prosecutor Seeks Death Penalty",
    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/charlie-kirk-shooting-suspect-tyler-robinson-charged-death-penalty/",
    "content": "Utah County prosecutors on Tuesday charged Tyler Robinson in the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, a murder officials say was politically motivated. They intend to seek the death penalty.\nUtah County Attorney Jeff Gray announced the indictment at a midday news conference, listing charges of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, and commission of a violent offense in the presence of a child. Robinson, 22, is also charged with two counts of obstruction and two counts of witness tampering.\n“Charlie Kirk was murdered while engaging in one of our most sacred and cherished American rights,” Gray said. “The bedrock of our democratic republic is the free exchange of ideas in a search for truth, understanding, and a more perfect union.”\nGray said that the murder was considered an aggravated offense because it was believed to be motivated by the victim’s political expression. On the matter of the death penalty, he added: “I do not take this decision lightly, and it is a decision I have made independently as county attorney based solely on the available evidence and circumstances and nature of the crime.”\nRobinson will make his first court appearance at 3 pm MST on Tuesday.\nKirk, 31, was fatally shot on September 10 while taking questions from students. The cofounder of Turning Point USA, he was credited with galvanizing young conservatives and playing a pivotal role in Donald Trump’s 2024 White House return.\nThe shooting sparked chaos on campus, where delayed and contradictory emergency alerts left many students and faculty scrambling in confusion. Vigils for Kirk have since been held in Arizona, New York, and Washington, among other states. Across the US, Kirk’s murder has become both a rallying cry for far-right retribution and fuel for an assault on civil society.\nInvestigators claim forensic evidence links Robinson to the shooting, with FBI director Kash Patel telling Fox & Friends that matching DNA was found on a towel wrapped around the rifle and on a screwdriver recovered from the rooftop where the fatal shot was fired. Patel also said investigators believe Robinson wrote a note of his alleged intent to kill Kirk, bolstering claims the attack was premeditated.\nAn indictment released Tuesday adds vivid details to the allegations. Prosecutors say surveillance footage captured Robinson climbing onto a campus rooftop, lying prone in a “sniper position,” and firing from nearly 160 yards away. Investigators recovered cartridges at the scene with hand-engraved messages, which prosecutors argue points to premeditation and motive.\nProsecutors also cited interviews with Robinson’s parents and roommate, who said he expressed anger that Kirk “spreads too much hate” and admitted he had “enough of his hatred.” The filing further alleges that Robinson told his roommate to stay silent if approached by police and that children were visible near the stage when Kirk was shot—factors prosecutors say aggravated the seriousness of the crime.\nThe indictment recounts an interview with Robinson's mother, who told investigators her son had grown more political in the past year \"and had started to lean more to the left,\" the indictment claims, citing \"pro-gay\" and \"trans-rights\" views. She described him as becoming increasingly consumed by online debates and grievances, noting his fixation with political topics seemed to intensify in the weeks leading up to the shooting, the indictment says. She added that Robinson had also begun to date his roommate, a transgender woman, adding that his father has “very different political views.”\nCharging documents recount an exchange that allegedly took place between Robinson and his roommate, who is said to be fully cooperating with authorities. According to the indictment, the roommate told police they found a note under Robinson’s keyboard reading, “I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I’m going to take it,” and later produced texts in which Robinson allegedly confessed, “I am, I’m sorry,” when asked if he was the one who murdered Kirk.\nIn the messages, Robinson allegedly described a plan to retrieve a stashed rifle, discussed wrapping the gun in a towel and leaving it in a bush to avoid prints, mentioning engraving cartridges as “a big meme,” and contemplated turning himself in through a neighbor who is a deputy.\n“remember how I was engraving bullets? The fuckin messages are mostly a big meme, if I see 'notices bulge uwu' on fox new I might have a stroke alright im gonna have to leave it, that really fucking sucks,” Robinson allegedly wrote in a text message, according to the indictment, citing one of the memes engraved on bullets discovered by investigators.\nRobinson repeatedly told the roommate to delete their messages, to refuse interviews, and to ask for a lawyer if questioned—details prosecutors cite as the basis for obstruction and witness-tampering counts.\nInvestigators are also scrutinizing Robinson’s digital footprint. Screenshots obtained by The Washington Post and other outlets allegedly show him confessing in a private Discord chat hours before surrendering: “It was me at UVU yesterday. i’m sorry for all of this.” The same user followed with another message saying he was about to turn himself in through “a sheriff friend.” Discord reportedly confirmed it gave copies of the messages to law enforcement and said it found no evidence that Robinson used the platform to plan or promote violence.\nRobinson was arrested roughly 33 hours after the shooting, with authorities saying his parents first recognized him in photos and urged him to surrender. He later turned himself in at the Washington County Sheriff’s Office.\nKirk’s murder was quickly weaponized to marshal power in Washington, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance spinning allegations in tandem about a broader left-wing conspiracy—neither offering any evidence to support their claims. On Monday, Vance hosted an episode of The Charlie Kirk Show from the White House, where he and other officials pledged a crackdown on liberal organizations vaguely accused of fueling unrest.\nCritics say the White House is exploiting the death to advance partisan aims, using an open criminal case to exact political retribution through the machinery of law.\nUS security services have long stressed that domestic extremism is driven by varied ideologies, from racially or ethnically motivated movements to anti-government and religious grievances. Multiple studies, nevertheless, have found that right-wing extremists commit far more attacks—and deadlier ones—than the left, a statistical reality that cuts directly against the administration’s script.\nA Department of Justice study showing that far-right extremist violence “continues to outpace all other types of terrorism and domestic violent extremism” in the US was removed from the DOJ’s website this week without explanation.\nUpdated 3:20 pm and 3:55 pm ET, September 16, 2025: Added additional details from the indictment against Robinson."

    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/baby-steps-is-a-hiking-game-that-trolls-slightly-problematic-men/",
    "content": "Game developer Bennett Foddy was watching a Greek myth unfold in front of him.\nA playtester for his latest project, Baby Steps, was struggling to navigate the game’s lead—Nate, a 35-year-old “failson” in a stained onesie—up a slippery hill. Each time, the terrain proved to be too much, and Nate skidded uselessly down it.\nFoddy has a reputation for making onerous games that take a little bit of masochism to master. This was not one of those times. Neatly placed next to the slippery hill was a staircase, which Foddy says the player took note of after the third or fourth fall. However, this modern-day Sisyphus refused to quit; he continued to flop Nate’s thick limbs up that hill again and again, and he continued to fall again and again. The playtester’s “intense need to climb that mudslide—it's funny to me, it's gratifying as a designer,” says Foddy. “I loved that he was doing it. Like, that's not productive.”\nUnbeknownst to the playtester, he was Foddy's target audience. Baby Steps, launching September 23 for PlayStation 5 and PC, entreats gamers to examine how much they unconsciously adhere to damaging masculine ideas, including an unwillingness to appear weak or incapable, whether that’s in how well they play a game or how willing they are to sometimes take the L. It makes its hero less like the muscled protagonists of games past and more like the players: unhelpfully stubborn types with what Foddy calls \"slightly problematic\" views of what it means to succeed that are actually holding them back.\nBaby Steps is a failure-to-launch story with an Isekai twist, as Nate is transported from the safety of his parents’ basement couch to an unfamiliar land. In trailers for the game, it’s easy to see what Foddy means. Nate lacks any semblance of a so-called man’s man. He’s awkward, unkempt, and overweight. He fumbles his words and can barely even walk without falling over; players control Nate by literally moving one leg at a time, controls reminiscent of ragdoll runner QWOP, the game that put Foddy on the map. Baby Steps players will likely spend much of their time tumbling off cliffs or pratfalling down gentle hills.\nFrom the start, Foddy says, Nate is offered help by someone who wants to teach him the ropes, give him a pair of shoes, maybe even a map. “And he can't accept that help,” Foddy says. “To me, that's a joke about a kind of symbolic masculine self-sufficiency and the limitations of that.” Foddy’s body of work has always been about difficulty and failure; Baby Steps is asking players to consider why they subject themselves to this sort of pain needlessly.\nIn video games, capital M masculinity has long been the standard for male leads: a (typically white) confident protagonist in good shape, demonstrating unusual strength in a hero role. The idea that games are made by men, for men, has been so pervasive in the history of video games that it’s prompted entire harassment campaigns targeting anyone who doesn’t fit that description. More extreme examples include pockets of online gaming culture where toxic communities persistently reject anyone they deem as “DEI”—women, people of color, marginalized communities—to uphold sexist and racist ideologies.\nIllinois Tech digital humanities and media studies professor Carly Kocurek says that while masculine tropes aren’t inherently bad, “they can limit the types of stories that get told and the kinds of ideas that make it to market, which can really dampen creativity and innovation.”\n“A lot of pop culture stories and media rely on a shared pool of influences,” says Kocurek. She points to movies like Star Wars that follow the hero’s journey, or fantasy characters like dwarves and elves that have been popularized by J.R.R. Tolkien and other writers. “We get certain ideas about what a hero is, what a man is, and we see them again and again.”\nConsider iconic game characters like Halo’s Master Chief, Metal Gear’s Solid Snake, or even Nintendo’s mustachioed plumber, Mario. “Even Spider-Man is kind of represented as a jock in video games,” says Foddy.\nFoddy, who developed Baby Steps alongside Ape Out developers Gabe Cuzzilo and Maxi Boch, says that most often, players adopt this role of a savior character—someone capable and self-sufficient who reflects a heroic ideal. Gender doesn’t always matter; Aloy, the heroine from the Horizon series, exhibits just as many masculine ideals as Nathan Drake of Uncharted. When it came to Baby Steps, the team wanted to go in the opposite direction: a character who’s trying to live up to those expectations but just isn’t capable of it.\nStill, Foddy says the game is sympathetic to its lead. He’s up to the task and by the game’s end will have scaled an entire mountain; he just doesn’t begin his journey very well equipped.\n“He's a nerd, as is everybody who made the game,” Foddy says. “We're also gamers, so you know, we're not out to get gamers.”\nPart of Baby Steps involves Nate, who comes from a wealthy family with plenty of opportunity, grappling with his own troublesome behavior. “He's part of the privileged, white-male default group,” Foddy says. “That's making his situation more burdensome for him because it underscores that his failures to accomplish success are of his own making.” But the team was not interested in parroting stereotypical bootstrap advice. “We really wanted to resist the kind of boomer morality play of ‘what you really need to do is get a job and start meeting your responsibilities,’ and ‘you're just lazy and you're too oriented to pleasure.’”\nIn playing this character, Foddy hopes people might reflect more on their own motivations and behavior, the why of what they’re doing. During his time as a developer, Foddy has noticed that there is a certain subset of gamers who refuse to take help. They’re the stereotype of a guy who won’t ask for directions or, for example, skips every in-game tutorial.\nOthers, he says, are of the “git gud” mindset—a slang way to say that you suck at video games and should try harder. Discussions around difficulty and skill have haunted video games spaces for more than a decade, whether it was about playing in online spaces or challenging series like Dark Souls; arguments about player skill versus how hard a game should be are already taking place in the Silksong community, roughly a week after its launch. “Many games really lean into competition as the primary experience,” Kocurek says, “and there is a kind of feedback loop because you get games that embed certain ideals and values that attract certain players who like those.”\nFoddy’s games often challenge what he calls “masculine pride” by repeatedly subjecting players to failure. Baby Steps is just a little more open about it in its narrative. Will the lesson land? Hard to say. The playtester determined to conquer the mudslide never did manage to brute-force it. “He started to feel like he was boring us after, you know, half an hour of it,” Foddy says.\nFoddy can relate; he too has found himself climbing difficult areas with no reward in other games. “Did I do that for masculine pride,” he says. “Or did I do it because I was actually taking pleasure in the moment-to-moment play? I don't think we even know why we're doing it half the time.”"

    "title": "A DHS Data Hub Exposed Sensitive Intel to Thousands of Unauthorized Users",
    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/a-dhs-data-hub-exposed-sensitive-intel-to-thousands-of-unauthorized-users/",
    "content": "The Department of Homeland Security's mandate to carry out domestic surveillance has been a concern for privacy advocates since the organization was first created in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Now a data leak affecting the DHS's intelligence arm has shed light not just on how the department gathers and stores that sensitive information—including about its surveillance of Americans—but on how it once left that data exposed to thousands of government and private sector workers and even foreign nationals who were never authorized to see it.\nWIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism.\nAn internal DHS memo obtained by a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and shared with WIRED reveals that from March to May of 2023, a DHS online platform used by the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) to share sensitive but unclassified intelligence information and investigative leads among the DHS, the FBI, the National Counterterrorism Center, local law enforcement, and intelligence fusion centers across the US was misconfigured, accidentally exposing restricted intelligence information to all users of the platform.\nAccess to the data, according to a DHS inquiry described in the memo, was meant to be limited to users of the Homeland Security Information Network's intelligence section, known as HSIN-Intel. Instead it was set to grant access to “everyone,” exposing the information to HSIN's tens of thousands of users. The unauthorized users who had access included US government workers focused on fields unrelated to intelligence or law enforcement such as disaster response, as well as private sector contractors and foreign government staff with access to HSIN.\n“DHS advertises HSIN as secure and says the information it holds is sensitive, critical national security information,” says Spencer Reynolds, an attorney for the Brennan Center for Justice who obtained the memo via FOIA and shared it with WIRED. “But this incident raises questions about how seriously they take information security. Thousands and thousands of users gained access to information they were never supposed to have.”\nHSIN-Intel's data includes everything from law enforcement leads and tips to reports on foreign hacking and disinformation campaigns, to analysis of domestic protest movements. The memo about the HSIN-Intel breach specifically mentions, for instance, a report discussing “protests relating to a police training facility in Atlanta”—likely the Stop Cop City protests opposing the creation of the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center—noting that it focused on “media praising actions like throwing stones, fireworks and Molotov cocktails at police.”\nIn total, according to the memo about the DHS internal inquiry, 439 I&A “products” on the HSIN-Intel portion of the platform were improperly accessed 1,525 times. Of those unauthorized access instances, the report found that 518 were private sector users and another 46 were non-US citizens. The instances of foreign user accesses were “almost entirely” focused on cybersecurity information, the report notes, and 39 percent of all the improperly accessed intelligence products involved cybersecurity, such as foreign state-sponsored hacker groups and foreign targeting of government IT systems. The memo also noted that some of the unauthorized US users who viewed the information would have been eligible to have accessed the restricted information if they’d asked to be considered for authorization.\n“When this coding error was discovered, I&A immediately fixed the problem and investigated any potential harm,” a DHS spokesperson told WIRED in a statement. “Following an extensive review, multiple oversight bodies determined there was no impactful or serious security breach. DHS takes all security and privacy measures seriously and is committed to ensuring its intelligence is shared with federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, and private sector partners to protect our homeland from the numerous adversarial threats we face.\"\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees US intelligence agencies, didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nAlthough the exposure occurred under the Biden administration, the memo highlights the risks of surveillance data collected on Americans that persists under the current administration, argues Jeramie Scott, the director of the Surveillance Oversight Program at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a digital rights nonprofit. In fact, he argues, the relative lack of transparency of the Trump administration and DHS's hostility to oversight measures suggests that if a similar data breach occurred now, the public might never know. As an example, he points to the effective shuttering of the 150-person DHS oversight arm known as the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. “If this was occurring then, is this type of thing going to be captured now?” Scott asks. \"Everyone should be concerned about the fact that things like this happen, and oversight has only deteriorated since this incident occurred.\"\nAccording to the memo about the DHS's inquiry into its intelligence exposure, the DHS Office of Privacy initially considered the breach to have had “minimal to low impact.\" But the author of the memo, whose name has been redacted in the form released under FOIA, determined that the Office of Privacy hadn't fully considered the personally identifiable information (PII) exposed in the breach, particularly that of Americans, contradicting that “low impact” assessment. The memo recommended as one finding of the inquiry that I&A retrain staff on the definitions of PII.\nTwo pieces of legislation currently before Congress seek to reform or restrict DHS's surveillance powers, one called the Strengthening Oversight of DHS Intelligence Act and another that would amend the Intelligence Authorization Act of 2026 to place new restrictions on funding for some DHS domestic surveillance programs. The Brennan Center's Reynolds notes, however, that the amendments have specific exceptions for DHS's sharing of intelligence with other government agencies or contractors, so likely wouldn't affect HSIN-Intel.\nThe memo about the DHS's inquiry into the HSIN-Intel data exposure, Reynolds also points out, doesn't assess the effects of the breach on all of the other organizations whose data was leaked in the incident, or even mention that other agencies' troves of sensitive data were impacted. “Given the volume of data, it's highly likely they would have been,” Reynolds says. “This should raise alarm bells for the agencies nationwide who trust the Office of Intelligence and Analysis with their information.”\nMore broadly, EPIC's Scott argues that the breach should concern not just the DHS or its partner agencies, but everyone who potentially falls under the DHS's surveillance remit—in other words, every American. “It affects everyone in the US because of the broadness of the surveillance and intelligence programs that they conduct,\" says Scott. “We're talking about an agency that's doing domestic intelligence. This implicates all of us.”"
