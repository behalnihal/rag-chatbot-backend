    "content": "A United Nations commission of inquiry says Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.\nA new report says there are reasonable grounds to conclude that four of the five genocidal acts defined under international law have been carried out since the start of the war with Hamas in 2023: killing members of a group, causing them serious bodily and mental harm, deliberately inflicting conditions calculated to destroy the group, and preventing births.\nIt cites statements by Israeli leaders, and the pattern of conduct by Israeli forces, as evidence of genocidal intent.\nIsrael's foreign ministry said it categorically rejected the report, denouncing it as \"distorted and false\".\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.\nAt least 64,964 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen as reliable by the UN.\nMost of the population has also been repeatedly displaced; more than 90% of homes are estimated to be damaged or destroyed; the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed; and UN-backed food security experts have declared a famine in Gaza City.\nThe Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory was established by the UN Human Rights Council in 2021 to investigate all alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.\nThe three-member expert panel is chaired by Navi Pillay, a South African former UN human rights chief who was president of the international tribunal on Rwanda's genocide. The two other members are Chris Sidoti, an Australian human rights lawyer, and Miloon Kothari, an Indian expert on housing and land rights.\nThe commission has previously concluded that Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes and other grave violations of international law on 7 October 2023, and that Israeli security forces have committed crimes against humanity and war crimes in Gaza.\nThe commission said its latest report was \"the strongest and most authoritative UN finding to date\" on the war. However, it does not officially speak for the UN.\nThe 72-page document alleges that Israeli authorities and Israeli security forces have committed and are continuing to commit four of the five acts of genocide defined under the 1948 Genocide Convention against a national, ethnic, racial or religious group - in this case, Palestinians in Gaza:\nTo fulfil the legal definition of genocide under the Genocide Convention, it must also be established that the perpetrator committed any one of those acts with specific intent to destroy the group in whole or in part.\n'We went to the facts first,\" Pillay told the BBC. \"So we looked at statements made by the Israeli authorities indicating genocidal intent. And we looked at the pattern of conduct of Israeli authorities and Israeli security forces to show that genocidal intent was the only reasonable inference.\"\nIsrael's political and military leaders have consistently said its military's operations in Gaza are conducted in self-defence, to defeat Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups, and to secure the release of Israeli hostages.\nThey have also insisted that Israeli forces operate in accordance with international law and take all feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians.\nHowever, the commission's report concludes that President Isaac Herzog, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant have \"incited the commission of genocide\" in their speeches and statements.\n\"As early as 7 October 2023, Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed to inflict… 'mighty vengeance' on 'all of the places where Hamas is deployed, hiding and operating in, that wicked city, we will turn them into rubble',\" Pillay said.\n\"His use of the phrase 'wicked city' in the same statement implied that he saw the whole city of Gaza [Gaza City] as responsible and a target for vengeance. And he told Palestinians to 'leave now because we will operate forcefully everywhere'.\"\nGallant said days after 7 October 2023 that Israel was \"fighting human animals, and we act accordingly\". Herzog meanwhile stated that \"it's an entire nation out there that is responsible\" for the Hamas-led attack.\nThe commission also says \"genocidal intent was the only reasonable inference\" that could be concluded from the pattern of conduct of Israeli authorities and security forces in Gaza.\nThat has allegedly included intentionally killing and seriously harming an unprecedented number of Palestinians using heavy munitions; systematic and widespread attacks on religious, cultural and education sites; imposing a siege on Gaza and starving its population.\nPillay added: \"It took us two years to gather all the actions and make factual findings, verify whether that had happened... It's only the facts that will direct you. And you can only bring it under the Genocide Convention if those acts were done with this intention.\"\nThe commission says the acts of Israeli political and military leaders are \"attributable to the State of Israel\", and that the state therefore \"bears responsibility for the failure to prevent genocide, the commission of genocide and the failure to punish genocide\".\nIt also warns all other countries have an immediate obligation under the Genocide Convention to \"prevent and punish the crime of genocide\", employing all measures at their disposal. If they do not, it says, they could be complicit.\nIn a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry accused the three members of the commission of serving as \"Hamas proxies\".\n\"The report relies entirely on Hamas falsehoods, laundered and repeated by others. These fabrications have already been thoroughly debunked,\" it said.\n\"In stark contrast to the lies in the report, Hamas is the party that attempted genocide in Israel - murdering 1,200 people, raping women, burning families alive, and openly declaring its goal of killing every Jew.\"\nAn Israeli military official dismissed the report as \"baseless\", saying: \"No other country has operated in these conditions and done so much to prevent harm to civilians on the battlefield.\"\nPresident Herzog also condemned the report, which he said had misinterpreted his words, according to Reuters news agency.\nThe Israeli foreign ministry also said that the commission's members should not be replaced when they step down from their roles later this year, and that the commission itself should instead be abolished.\nIn July, all three members submitted their resignations to the UN Human Rights Council. Pillay, who is 83, cited her \"age, medical issues and the weight of several other commitments\", while Sidoti said her retirement marked \"an appropriate time to reconstitute the commission\".\nA number of international and Israeli human rights organisations, independent UN experts, and scholars have also accused Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.\nThe UN says it cannot make a legal determination as to whether a situation constitutes genocide under international law. It says a situation is referred to as genocide only after a competent national or international court has declared it as such.\nWhen asked by journalists on Tuesday if he would consider using the word genocide to describe Israel's actions in Gaza, UN human rights chief Volker Türk said: \"It's for the court to decide whether it's genocide or not, and we see the evidence mounting.\"\nA spokesman for the UK government also said the decision was up to a court, but added that this \"does not take away from our position that Israel's actions are appalling\".\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) is currently hearing a case brought by South Africa that accuses Israeli forces of genocide, but it could take years to reach a conclusion. Israel has called the case \"wholly unfounded\" and based on \"biased and false claims\"."

    "title": "Jeremy Bowen: UN genocide report a blunt indictment of Israel's actions in Gaza",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m4rxjppl8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "The report is intended to be detailed and damning, presenting evidence it says shows that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. It says that Israel has breached the Genocide Convention that was passed in 1948 by the newly established United Nations. The word genocide, and the convention that defined it as a crime, were directly inspired by the genocide of six million Jews by Nazi Germany.\nIsrael denies all allegations that its conduct in Gaza has broken the treaties and conventions that make up the laws of war and international humanitarian law. It justifies its actions as self-defence, in protection of its citizens and to force the release of the hostages taken by Hamas and Islamic Jihad on 7 October 2023, around 20 of whom are believed still to be alive.\nThe Israelis have dismissed the report as antisemitic lies inspired by Hamas. It was compiled by a commission of inquiry set up by the UN Human Rights Council. Israel and the US are boycotting the Council, which both countries say is biased against them.\nBut the findings of the report will feed into the growing international condemnation of Israel's conduct, which is also coming from Israel's traditional western allies as well as the Gulf Arab monarchies that normalised relations with Israel in the Abraham Accords.\nNext week at the UN General Assembly in New York, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Canada and others are due to join the majority of UN members by recognising the sovereignty of an independent Palestinian state.\nThe move will be more than symbolic. It will change the debate about the future of the conflict that began more than a century ago when Zionist Jews from Europe came to settle in Palestine. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, has condemned recognition as antisemitic, and a reward for Hamas terrorism.\nHe says the Palestinians will never have independence in any part of the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea, as a Palestinian state would put Israelis in danger. Israeli religious nationalists believe the land was granted to the Jewish people alone by God.\nGenocide is defined in the 1948 convention, as the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group – in this case, Palestinians in Gaza.\nThe report details actions against Palestinians inside Gaza and in jails inside Israel.\nAmong a long list of accusations is Israeli targeting of civilians that it has a legal obligation to protect, and the imposition of \"inhumane conditions causing the death of Palestinians, including the deprivation of food, water and medicines\". That is a reference to the blockade that has produced a famine as well as widespread starvation, according to the IPC, the international body that assesses food emergencies.\nThe new UN report also details forced displacement, currently happening in Gaza City after the Israeli military, the IDF, ordered all civilians there to move south. Around one million people are believed to be affected. Israel's offensive is gathering pace, with air strikes and the destruction of many buildings, including high rises that are symbols of Gaza City, which the IDF calls Hamas \"terror towers\". The report also says that Israel has imposed \"measures intended to prevent births\". That refers to an attack on Gaza's largest fertility clinic that reportedly destroyed around 4000 embryos and 1000 sperm samples and unfertilised eggs.\nAs well as the results of military action, the UN report singles out three Israeli officials for inciting genocide.\nThey are Yoav Gallant, then the defence minister, who said on 9 October 2023 that Israel was fighting \"human animals\". Like Prime Minister Netanyahu, Gallant already faces an arrest warrant for war crimes from the International Criminal Court.\nNetanyahu is also accused of incitement by comparing the Gaza war to the story of the Jewish fight against an enemy known as Amalek. In the bible God tells the Jewish people to eliminate all the Amalek men, women and children, as well as their possessions and their animals.\nThe third official singled out is President Isaac Herzog, who in the first week of the war condemned Gaza's Palestinians for not rising up against Hamas. He said on 13 October 2023 that \"it's an entire nation out there that is responsible\".\nLegally, it is hard to prove the crime of genocide. The people who framed the Genocide Convention, and interpretations made by the ICJ in more recent cases deliberately set a high legal bar.\nAt the International Court of Justice in The Hague, South Africa has brought a case that Israel has committed genocide against the Palestinians. It will take several years for the case to be adjudicated.\nBut with the war in Gaza continuing and perhaps escalating further with the current Israeli offensive, the UN report is going to deepen international divisions about the war.\nOn one side are countries who demand an immediate end to the killing and destruction in Gaza, and condemn the famine caused by Israel's siege. They include the UK and France.\nOn the other are Israel, and the United States. The administration of President Donald Trump continues to provide vital military aid and diplomatic cover without which the Israelis would struggle to continue the war in Gaza and its bombing campaigns elsewhere in the Middle East."

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c749q1245pwo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "Israel has launched its long-planned major ground offensive on Gaza City, conducting heavy air strikes overnight as troops pushed into the edges of the city.\nThousands of Palestinians have been forced to flee down a single coastal road to the centre of the Strip, joining hundreds of thousands who have already fled.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a \"powerful operation\" had been launched against Hamas's \"last major stronghold\" but UN human rights chief Volker Türk condemned the assault as \"totally and utterly unacceptable\".\nElsewhere, a UN commission of inquiry found that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.\nHuge columns of Palestinians were seen streaming towards the south in donkey carts, rickshaws, vehicles strapped high with belongings or on foot.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) estimates 350,000 people have already fled Gaza City, though more than that number are thought to have remained.\nMany Palestinians say they cannot afford to go south, while others say southern and central Gaza are not safe as Israel has carried out air strikes there too. Some have said they attempted to go south but found no space to pitch their tents, so returned to Gaza City.\nLina al-Maghrebi, 32, a mother of three from the city's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, said: \"I was forced to sell my jewellery to cover the cost of displacement and a tent.\"\n\"It took us ten hours to reach Khan Younis, and we paid 3,500 shekels [£735] for the ride. The line of cars and trucks seemed endless.\"\nGaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 59 people were killed and at least 386 injured in the past 24 hours. Three people, it adds, died as a result of famine and malnutrition, including one child.\n\"Gaza is burning,\" Israel's Defence Minister, Israel Katz, wrote on X, as the offensive began. \"The IDF strikes with an iron fist at the terrorist infrastructure and IDF soldiers are fighting bravely to create the conditions for the release of the hostages and the defeat of Hamas.\"\nAn IDF official said ground troops were moving deeper into the city and that up to 3,000 Hamas combatants remained in the city.\nThe UN commission of inquiry said its latest report was \"the strongest and most authoritative UN finding to date\" on the war. However, it does not officially speak for the UN.\nAmong its findings are that Israeli security forces perpetrated \"sexual and gender-based violence\", directly targeted children with the intention to kill them, and carried out a \"systemic and widespread attack\" on religious, cultural and education sites in Gaza.\nNavi Pillay, the chair of the panel that produced the report, said: \"The genocide convention was born out of humanity's darkest chapters.\"\n\"Today, we witness in real time how the promise of never again is broken and tested in the eyes of the world,\" she added.\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 64,964 people have been killed by Israel during its campaign since then - almost half of them women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry.\nWith famine having already been declared in the area by a UN-backed body, the UN has warmed an intensification of the offensive will push civilians into \"even deeper catastrophe\"."

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn834zwe83lo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "The prime minister has ordered a new investigation into how MI5 gave false evidence to three courts about conversations with the BBC.\nSir Keir Starmer's direction follows requests from the High Court and Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which both rejected MI5's explanations about what happened.\nThe case centres on a neo-Nazi state informant known as Agent X who used his MI5 role to coerce his girlfriend, whom he attacked with a machete.\nOn Tuesday, the prime minister wrote to the Investigatory Powers Commissioner Sir Brian Leveson directing him to conduct a new inquiry.\nIn a written statement to Parliament, Sir Keir said: \"I have now issued a direction to the Commissioner to commence this investigation immediately.\" He said the courts \"will use the outcome of this investigation to determine their next steps in relation to the case of Agent X\".\nSir Keir noted that the relevant courts had found that MI5's investigations into the false evidence \"suffered from serious procedural deficiencies\".\nIn a letter to Sir Brian, the prime minister said the courts had \"rightly expressed their displeasure at MI5 for providing this false evidence\".\nIn February, the BBC revealed that MI5 had lied to three courts while defending its handling of the misogynistic MI5 agent, whom the BBC had sought to expose in a 2022 investigation.\nArguing for secrecy, the Security Service told judges it had stuck to its policy of not confirming or denying informants' identities.\nIn fact, MI5 had disclosed the Agent X's status in phone calls to me, as it tried to persuade me not to investigate him. The service aggressively maintained its position until I produced evidence proving it was untrue, including a recording of one of the calls.\nFollowing the BBC's revelations, MI5's Director General Sir Ken McCallum apologised. Two official inquiries then took place which absolved MI5 and its officers of deliberate wrongdoing, claiming the false evidence was down to mistakes and poor memories.\nBut, in July, a panel of senior high court judges ruled that the \"investigations carried out by MI5 to date suffer from serious procedural deficiencies\" and that \"we cannot rely on their conclusions\". They said it would be \"premature\" to decide whether to begin contempt of court proceedings against any MI5 officers before a new investigation took place.\nLater the same month, the investigatory powers tribunal also rejected MI5's explanations and requested a new investigation.\nThe new investigation will be carried out under the auspices of the Investigatory Powers Commissioner Sir Brian Leveson, who has oversight of MI5's surveillance activities. His office, IPCO, was also provided with false evidence by MI5 in the case.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"The Home Secretary is concerned that inaccurate evidence was provided to the High Court and Investigatory Powers Tribunal. The Director General of MI5 has rightly apologised for this serious failing, both publicly and to the Courts.\n\"Both courts concluded that further investigation was necessary to determine how incorrect evidence came to be presented to them. The government accepted their recommendations and the Prime Minister has commissioned Sir Brian Leveson – the Investigatory Powers Commissioner – to lead this investigation. It would be inappropriate to comment further until it is completed.\""

    "content": "King Charles and other senior royals are attending the funeral of Katharine, the Duchess of Kent at Westminster Cathedral.\nBut Queen Camilla sent her \"deep regrets\" at having to miss the service because she was recovering from acute sinusitis.\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales, who have paid warm tributes to the music-loving duchess, are among the mourners at the Requiem Mass, alongside the Duke of Kent and their three children.\nThis is the first Catholic funeral for a member of the Royal Family in modern times - and a message from Pope Leo was read out during the service.\nThe Pope's message praises the duchess for her \"dedication to official duties, patronage of charities and devoted care for vulnerable people\" and sent his \"heartfelt condolences, together with the assurance of my prayerful closeness\" to the King, the Duke of Kent and their family.\nQueen Camilla's absence because of ill health was announced by the palace ahead of the funeral.\n\"Her thoughts and prayers will be with the Duke of Kent and all the family,\" said a statement from Buckingham Palace.\nBut the palace said that despite this painful inflammation of the sinuses, the Queen still plans to take part in the state visit of President Trump, who will be in Windsor on Wednesday.\nCrowds gathered outside the Byzantine-style church in Westminster on Tuesday afternoon as the family and friends of the duchess arrived for the funeral, which is a private service.\nSophie, Duchess of Edinburgh; Princess Anne and her husband Sir Tim Laurence and Prince Andrew with his former wife Sarah Ferguson were among the royals attending. The coffin of the duchess was brought to the cathedral on Monday, draped in the royal standard and with white roses among the flowers, in honour of the duchess' Yorkshire roots.\nThe duchess was the oldest member of the Royal Family when she died earlier this month at the age of 92. She was married to the first cousin of the late Queen Elizabeth II.\nThere have been many memories of her kindness and her dedication to charities.\nCardinal Vincent Nichols, who presided over the funeral service, has spoken of how the duchess often volunteered at the Passage charity for the homeless, which is based next door to the cathedral.\nSpeaking ahead of the funeral, he remembered her as a \"very down to earth person\" who had helped in the kitchen and with cleaning at the charity.\n\"So as well as combining royal duties, she entered very wholeheartedly into serving people,\" Cardinal Nichols told the BBC.\nThis is a historic moment in terms of being a royal Catholic funeral, but the Cardinal said it should be seen primarily as a \"family funeral where the members of the family gather round\". \"One of their oldest members has died. A woman who was greatly loved within that family and also, as we've seen, by much of the public,\" said Cardinal Nichols.\nThe duchess had a deep love of music and had worked as a primary school music teacher, calling herself Mrs Kent, with the pupils not knowing anything about her royal life.\nMusic at the funeral will include Ave Verum Corpus by Mozart, which was selected by the duchess as her favourite piece when she was a guest on the BBC's Desert Island Discs in 1990.\nA piper will play the lament Sleep, Dearie, Sleep, which was played at the funeral of the late Queen, which was three years ago this week.\nThere will also be music by JS Bach and from the requiem by French composer Maurice Durufle.\nThe duchess will also be remembered as a familiar figure at the Wimbledon tennis championships, where she handed over trophies - and consoled those who had lost, including a tearful Jana Novotna in 1993.\nAfter the funeral at Westminster Cathedral, the coffin will be taken to the royal burial ground in Frogmore, on the Windsor estate.\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lelqg0jy3o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "A group of teenagers from Bradford, the 2025 UK City of Culture, agreed to take all technology out of their bedrooms for five days to see how they would cope.\nWe followed two of them, Elizabeth and Henry, to capture the highs and lows - and to see how long they lasted before giving in to temptation.\nThirteen-year-old Elizabeth says she rarely spends time with her parents after school.\nThe self-confessed Sabrina Carpenter fan normally heads straight to her bedroom for \"three or four hours\" to watch YouTube videos of her pop idol and chat to her friends.\n\"My bedroom is basically my peace place,\" she says.\nBut she is one of four teenagers at her secondary school to sign up to a tech-free bedroom challenge. It's all part of this year's Teen Summit, a project from Radio 5 Live and BBC Bitesize Study Support.\nThe annual event explores issues affecting teenagers, from smartphones to social media and knife crime to misinformation.\nThe teenagers will still be able to use their tech, including phones, tablets and laptops - but only in the communal areas of the house.\n\"It's going to be hard,\" says Elizabeth. \"I'm someone who likes to be in my room.\"\nElizabeth's dad, Robin, thinks she will \"crack before the end of the week\" and take her phone into her bedroom.\n\"That's going to be a challenge for her,\" he says as Elizabeth starts to laugh. He's so confident, in fact, that he's made a bet with his daughter.\n\"If she cracks, Dad gets a big bag of wine gums.\"\nOther students at Elizabeth's West Yorkshire school are also taking part in the project, including 15-year-old Eliza, who says the lack of private space to talk to friends is on her mind.\n\"I plan on making it as inconvenient as possible for [my family],\" she says, describing her plan to spend time in shared family spaces, such as \"on the stairs\" and \"on the sofa, but where they want to sit\".\nMichelle, 15, plans to \"read a book to fall asleep\", instead of staying up on her phone and laptop. She says usually a normal night's sleep can be as little as \"five hours, max\".\nHenry, 13, spends most of his time at home gaming with his friends online until nine or 10 at night. However \"the latest I've stayed up is probably about 2am,\" he says sheepishly.\n\"There's sometimes where I'll be gaming that I forget to even drink water.\"\nIn July, new rules come into force as part of the Online Safety Act to try and make the internet safer for young people.\nChildren's commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza says while these changes are \"welcome and long overdue\", parents should set boundaries for their children by \"introducing phone-free time or unplugging before bed to promote better rest and wellbeing\".\nAn online survey of two thousand 13- to 18-year-olds, conducted for BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Bitesize by Survation, suggests 38% of the teens who identify as gamers spend seven or more hours per week gaming in their bedroom. One in 10 boys spends more than 20 hours a week in their room away from their family.\nHenry stored his PlayStation in a cupboard at the start of the week to try and avoid temptation, but it only stayed there for \"about two hours\" before being put into the living room.\nIt's a space where his mum, Alyson, often spends her evenings too, with Henry having to remind his friends to not swear when they're speaking on their headsets.\nAlthough he says it means he can't \"speak as freely\" with his friends, Alyson says it has helped to \"open up the conversation\" between the pair.\nIt has also made her realise how much of Henry's friendships are built around online gaming.\n\"That's the biggest part. It's not really about playing the games, it's the social aspect.\"\nHe says another bonus of leaving his tech outside his bedroom at night has meant he hasn't got caught up watching \"billions of videos\" on TikTok just before he goes to sleep.\nHenry says he is already sleeping much better, which in turn has \"helped in school… in all subjects and all aspects\".\nImproved sleep quality is something Dr Kaitlyn Regehr, associate prof in digital humanities at University College London, says she would expect the teens to experience after removing digital devices from their rooms.\n\"There are increasing reports of teens feeling tired during the school day because of their smartphone usage,\" she says.\nShe adds that teens \"still need lots of sleep\", which can be disrupted by overnight notifications or late-night exposure to blue light through smartphone screens.\nReflecting on Henry and Elizabeth's gaming, Dr Regehr says basic safety checks parents can do include checking if a teen knows exactly who it is they are gaming with, not having geo-locators turned on, and making sure the themes within the game are age-appropriate.\nBy Wednesday, Elizabeth says she has found other unexpected benefits and has spent her evenings researching ballet lessons and baking chocolate chip bread \"out of boredom\".\n\"If I still had my tech, I would have procrastinated baking [until] next week,\" she says.\nHer parents, Robin and Grace, say they've also noticed a change, with Elizabeth choosing to watch documentaries on the family TV rather than online videos in her room.\n\"[The project has] given her an idea that there's other things to do besides going on your mobile phone and your computer,\" says Robin.\nAs the project comes to an end, the four teenagers swap stories of their tech-free week.\nMichelle says she almost gave up on the challenge multiple times as she would like \"some peace and quiet\", while Eliza says being in a \"really bad mood\" with her family meant she went to the cinema with her friends.\n\"It was really fun actually… a lot better than sitting at home,\" she says.\n\"I wouldn't normally do that stuff, mainly opting to stay on my phone after school.\"\nBut what about the book Michelle planned to read through the week?\n\"I think I read one chapter, that's it,\" she says, adding \"the reality is it's not going to happen\".\nIn a survey of 2,224 13 to 18-year-olds, conducted for BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Bitesize, young people were asked about various aspects of life - including their smartphone habits, gaming and screen time.\nThe findings of the survey, carried out by polling company Survation, suggest:\nBack at home, Henry gleefully rips the 'tech free zone' sign off his bedroom door and instantly moves his PlayStation back onto his desk, but he says he will continue with some new habits he has picked up throughout the week.\n\"I'll keep my phone outside my bedroom at night because that has helped so much with my sleep.\"\n\"I'm really proud,\" says his mum, Alyson. \"He's done really well.\"\nElizabeth's dad Robin is similarly impressed with his daughter's resilience - but it does mean he lost his bet.\n\"A deal's a deal,\" he says as he hands over two packets of sweets. \"Well done.\"\nThe BBC asked social media and technology companies for the measures they put in place to help young users limit their screen time."

    "content": "Former Conservative health minister Maria Caulfield has become the latest Tory to join Nigel Farage's Reform UK Party.\nCaulfield lost her seat to the Lib Dems at last year's general election after nearly nine years as the MP for Lewes.\nShe told GB News she joined Reform a month ago because the Conservative Party had become \"less and less what I believe in\". Reform confirmed she has joined as a member. Caulfield is the 15th former Tory MP to join the party.\nThe latest defection comes after Danny Kruger, who sat on Tory leader Kemi Badenoch's team as a shadow work and pensions minister, became the first sitting Tory MP to defect on Monday.\nCaulfield told GB News: \"The [Reform] party needs a lot of experience of people who know the system and can talk about this.\"\n\"If you are Conservative right-minded, then the future is Reform. The country is going to change a lot,\" she said.\n\"The same people who thought that Brexit would not happen think that Reform will not happen. They are in for a shock.\"\nShe added: \"I am sad for the Conservative Party. I could see that I have not changed but the party has become less and less what I believe in.\"\nResponding to the defection, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch told broadcasters: \"Conservatives are the only party that are talking about how we need to deliver a stronger economy, living within our means, cutting welfare spending. \"We have got a plan to start getting growth back - Labour do not, and Reform are merely focused on Westminster bubble issues about who is in which party. \"That's not going to make life better for all the people out there.\"\nCaulfield is a Brexit supporter and quit her role as Tory vice chair in protest at Theresa May's 2018 attempt at a softer withdrawal from the EU, known as the Chequers deal.\nAt the time, she told May her plan would not capitalise on the opportunities of Brexit.\nShe has previously served in a number of junior ministerial roles, including as a health minister.\nHer appointment by May as minister for women in 2018 sparked a backlash from women's rights groups because of her opposition to decriminalising abortion.\nJames MacCleary, the Liberal Democrat who won Caulfield's seat in Lewes last year, said the move showed Farage \"doesn't care about our NHS\" because \"the Conservatives left our NHS on its knees\".\nHe added: \"Rather than offering solutions to the problems our country faces, Reform seems to be welcoming in the people that were responsible for causing them in the first place.\"\nThe BBC has contacted Caulfield for comment.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "content": "People drawing their new state pension from April are likely to see a rise of more than £500 a year, latest wages data suggests.\nUnder the \"triple lock\" policy, the state pension goes up each year by either 2.5%, inflation, or average earnings growth - whichever is the highest figure.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed total pay including bonuses for the three months to July was 4.7%, which is likely to be the figure used for the annual increase. Almost 13 million people receive the state pension in the UK and current projections suggest pensioners will pay income tax on it from 2027 for the first time.\nThe latest wage figures from the ONS likely means: With inflation forecast to be 4% in September, it is likely Tuesday's average earnings growth figure will be used to set the increase in the state pension for the third year in a row.\nSir Steve Webb, partner at pension consultants LCP and former pensions minister, said the standard rate of the new state pension was \"creeping ever closer to the frozen personal tax allowance\", which currently stands at £12,570 and is set to remain at the same level until 2028.\nThe standard personal allowance is the amount of income permitted each year without paying income tax.\nSir Steve said that someone with no other income aside from the new state pension is set to be a taxpayer come April 2027. \"It is already the case that nearly three quarters of all pensioners pay income tax, and the ongoing freeze in tax thresholds coupled with steady rises in the pension will drag more and more into the tax net,\" he added.\nLinda, a retired hairdresser from Wokingham, told the BBC she was worried her state pension was being pushed towards the tax threshold.\n\"They're giving it on one hand and it's taken away in the other, so that's not a load of good,\" she said.\n\"If they could raise the tax threshold it would make a huge difference.\"\nThe pensioner said she would struggle to manage on the state pension if she lived on her own.\n\"I'm lucky that my husband's got a good pension so we have a fairly reasonable lifestyle but if left alone I don't know what would happen to be honest.\"\nAccording to the ONS, regular wage growth - excluding bonuses - dropped to 4.8% in the three months to July, down from 5% in the previous three months and the lowest since May 2022.\nAverages earnings growth in the public sector was 5.6% over the same period, while pay increases in the private sector were 4.7%.\nLiz McKeown, the ONS director of economic statistics, said salary increases remained \"strong by historic standards\" despite it edging down further in cash terms.\nHowever, Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, said earnings growth was \"likely to continue to decline over the coming year\".\n\"Demand for workers has fallen sharply due to a combination of weaker economic activity and businesses facing higher labour costs. As a result, we expect wage growth to fall below 4% by the end of the year,\" she added.\nNot all pensioners receive the full state pension because it depends on years of qualifying contributions through the National Insurance system.\nFor many retired people, the state pension is not their only source of income as they will also receive money from workplace or private pensions.\nThe state pension is the second-largest item in the government budget after health spending.\nThe Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition designed the triple lock in 2011 to ensure the value of the state pension was not overtaken by the increase in the cost of living or the incomes of working people.\nBut there has been intense debate over the cost of the triple lock and whether it is justified, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves previously pledging that the Labour government would keep it in place until the end of the current parliament.\nIn July, the government's official forecaster said the cost of the triple lock guarantee was set to be three times higher by the end of the decade than was originally anticipated when it began.\nWork and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said the government promised to \"honour\" the triple lock for the \"course of this parliament\". \"It is estimated that will mean a rise in the State Pension of around £1,900 a year by the end of the parliament,\" he said.\nThe latest ONS data also revealed the UK unemployment rate hit at 4.7% in the three months to July, a level not seen since May 202. There was also a 10,000 drop in vacancies over the quarter to August, while the number of payrolled workers fell last month by 8,000. Ms McKeown said the labour market was continuing \"to cool\" with firms telling the ONS there were \"fewer jobs\" available.\nBut the rate of decline \"appears to be slowing\", she said."

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czewlj57e24o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has told suppliers that production at its factories will not resume until 24 September at the earliest following a serious cyber attack, but industry sources have warned disruption could last into November.\nThe hack, which occurred more than two weeks ago, forced JLR to shut down its IT networks and paralysed production. A criminal investigation is under way.\nJLR has dismissed reports that the operational impact of the attack may continue for weeks or months as \"speculation\".\nBut concerns are growing about the impact of the stoppage on the carmaker's extensive supply chain, amid claims some companies could face bankruptcy without prompt financial support.\nThe shutdown is believed to be costing the company at least £50m a week in lost production. JLR would normally expect to build more than 1,000 cars a day.\nThe firm, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, has car plants in Solihull and Halewood, as well as an engine facility in Wolverhampton.\nIt also has large factories in Slovakia and China, as well as a smaller facility in India. But all of the production lines have been at a standstill since 1 September when the hack first came to light.\nAnnouncing the latest delay, JLR said: \"We have taken this decision as our forensic investigation of the cyber incident continues and as we consider the different stages of the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time.\n\"We are very sorry for the continued disruption this incident is causing and we will continue to update as the investigation progresses.\"\nJLR initially appeared confident that the situation would be resolved quickly. However, it has since become clear that restarting production is not a simple process.\nThe company has admitted some data may have been viewed or stolen by third parties as a result of the cyber attack. By 24 September, three and a half weeks of output will have been lost. Industry insiders say that even once the production lines have restarted, getting back to normal output is likely to take several weeks.\nAmong suppliers, many of whom are small and medium sized businesses, there is growing concern.\nSeveral have told the BBC they simply do not have the financial resources to cope with an extended shutdown and industry experts have said bankruptcies are likely, unless some kind of support is provided.\nJason Richards, West Midlands regional officer at Unite the union, told the BBC: \"We're already seeing employers having discussions on potential redundancies. People have to pay rent, they have to pay mortgages and if they're not getting any pay, what are they supposed to do?\n\"We need to have a supply chain into Jaguar Land Rover. I can't emphasise it enough [because] if they turn the tap on and they're expecting the supply chain to be waiting on the subs bench, they won't be there,\" he added.\nWith hundreds of thousands of people working in the sector, analysts say there is a risk of lasting damage to the country's engineering base.\nUnite has called for a furlough scheme to be set up, which would use government money to help pay the salaries of people in the sector who are unable to work due to the stoppage.\nThe Commons Business and Trade Committee has also asked the chancellor what plans she has to support vulnerable businesses in the supply chain. JLR itself is understood to have been holding talks with some suppliers about potential support.\nWhile a number of suppliers have expressed concern about a lack of information provided to them by JLR, one leading contractor has defended the company.\n\"We should not forget who is to blame here,\" said David Roberts, chair of Evtec Group.\n\"All of this is the fault of criminals. JLR is the victim here. We should remember who started this - and it wasn't JLR.\"\nA group calling itself Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters has claimed responsibility for the hack. It was also behind a number of high-profile attacks on retailers earlier this year, among them Marks & Spencer and Co-op."

    "title": "Trump's state visit is mired with potential pitfalls despite careful planning",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gw25w9841o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "Listen to James read this article US President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom this week will be no stranger to controversy, just as his first was six years ago.\nBack then, in June 2019, as well as taking tea with the late Queen, the US President called London Mayor Sadiq Khan \"a stone-cold loser\", backed Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership race and suggested the NHS should be part of US-UK trade talks.\nAll this was accompanied by a petition saying he should not receive a state visit in the UK, signed by more than one million people, as well as noisy protests involving thousands and a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby.\nThis week's second state visit – unprecedented for a non-royal - will prove the first was no exception. There will again be protests and Lord Mandelson's sacking as UK ambassador to the US has already cast a diplomatic pall over proceedings.\nPlanning for the visit - over Wednesday and Thursday - has gone on for months, but for all the careful preparation, the possibility that things could go wrong is still very real. And for many of those organising it, the Mandelson affair is only one of their worries.\nFor those at the royal end of the show, the focus has been on logistics and security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel hard enough to satisfy even the most fastidious secret service agents.\nSuch has been the huge American presence some locals have renamed Windsor \"Trumpton\", after the eponymous town in the 1970s children's TV show.\nFor Palace officials, attention to detail is all.\nOne of the biggest problems has been finding a place to muster the Household Cavalry.\nIt needs to be far enough from the helicopter landing zones to ensure the horses are not spooked by the noise, close enough to form the escort quickly that will accompany the Trumps' carriage procession through the grounds of Windsor Castle.\nThere has also been much discussion between the Palace and Foreign Office over who sits where at the State Banquet in St George's Hall.\n\"The value of these things are not just the photo opportunities but also all the off-grid conversations,\" said one royal insider. \"A huge amount of attention goes into the seating plan for the banquet. So people with certain policy areas are sat next to one another.\"\nMuch thought, too, is devoted to the menu and the music which will involve \"lots of nods to his Scottish heritage\".\nKing Charles III's seven-minute speech at the banquet has gone through many drafts, ensuring he pushes the right buttons without crossing political lines.\nOfficials say they have been given no indication by their US counterparts of what Trump may say in his speech.\nSo far, so logistical – but the key challenge for royal organisers has been finding a way of ensuring Trump feels he has been given a full state visit with all the trimmings. That is no easy task.\nThe president is on the ground for less than 48 hours and will not visit Downing Street, address Parliament or even find time to play a round of golf.\n\"There has been a large amount of government pressure to make this massive and that's been the challenge,\" one courtier told me.\nThe scale of the ceremonial at Windsor has been stepped up, with 1,300 troops and 120 horses involved - far more than those used when President Macron of France visited earlier this year. (It's a point that will no doubt be emphasised to the Americans in private.)\nFor the ceremonial hoopla is the overwhelming focus of the White House in this visit; a chance for the President to be photographed with the King and Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with military parades and bands and the Red Arrows.\nOne Whitehall source said: \"The focus is very much on the optics, the historic moment, the pomp. For Trump it's all about TV and this is great TV.\"\nAnother said: \"It's theatre. It's all show. It's not like we are going to do deep substance. We are sucking up to the most powerful guy in the world for good reason.\"\nLord McDonald, a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office, said the UK's strategic choice to afford the most powerful man in the world \"the fullest honour British protocol allows\" will be watched closely by the rest of the world.\n\"This state visit is not just a UK-US event,\" he said. \"It will be one of the biggest stories around the world. \"The rest of the world will be looking at London and Windsor, burnishing the UK's wider international standing.\"\nMany officials are confident the visit will go smoothly, simply because all sides want it to succeed.\nThey emphasise that Palace staff thought the Trumps were warm and solicitous guests in 2019, both keen not to put a foot wrong. \"Trump can be quite funny in private,\" said one diplomat. \"He has got quite a neat turn of phrase that the King will appreciate.\"\nFor the UK government, the overwhelming aim is for Air Force One to take off on Thursday evening with Trump warmly disposed to Britain.\nBeyond providing a day of royal pageantry, the government has business to conduct on Thursday when proceedings move to the prime minister's country residence at Chequers.\nMinisters hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffs. There will be some new civil nuclear cooperation.\nThe centrepiece is set to be the signing of a technology partnership, involving new investment in Britain and greater cooperation with Silicon Valley on artificial intelligence and quantum computing.\nThis was Lord Mandelson's priority, something he described in his outgoing letter to embassy staff last week as \"my personal pride and joy\", that he claimed would \"help write the next chapter of the special relationship\".\nAll these issues will be portrayed as big domestic \"wins\" to help promote the government's growth agenda.\nThe visit will also provide Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with a significant opportunity to bend the ear of the president just a week before the United Nations general assembly in New York, especially on Ukraine.\nJeremy Hunt, who as Foreign Secretary was heavily involved in the last Trump state visit, said this was a key chance to shape the president's thinking.\n\"Trump appears to be on a journey away from Putin, towards recognising that he needs a way of standing with his European allies a bit better,\" Hunt said.\n\"What the government will really be wanting to do is continue that journey, looking for a deal to impose more sanctions on countries buying Russian oil.\"\nSophia Gaston, senior research fellow at King's College London, said the state visit was an important chance for the UK to influence US policy at a crucial stage of the Trump administration, a window of opportunity between its disruptive first six months and next year when its focus may shift to domestic elections and strategic competition with China.\n\"We are moving into a new phase,\" she said. \"This state visit really does matter. It is about us securing a foothold as the primary symbolic and strategic ally of the United States.\"\nFor all these potential gains, the risks are huge and the most obvious involves, of course, Lord Mandelson.\nThe peer's dismissal as ambassador, after revelations of the scale of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein following Epstein's conviction as a paedophile, means the press conference at Chequers on Thursday will not be dominated by questions about his future.\nInstead, the prime minister will likely be asked why he appointed the peer in the first place and why he took so long to sack him; what did he know and when?\nSome diplomats wonder if Trump may voice an opinion about who should replace Lord Mandelson, potentially putting No 10 in an invidious position.\nBut perhaps the most dangerous question for the Prime Minister may be why he thinks Lord Mandelson should be punished for his links to Epstein, but not the US President standing next to him.\nAccording to Whitehall sources, this was a point Lord Mandelson deployed as he fought to save his job. It was not an argument that found favour in No 10 and officials note Trump, unlike Lord Mandelson, cut ties with Epstein well before his conviction - but it is a question that will float above this week's royal and political ceremonial.\nDiplomats I have spoken to insist that so far the White House has been sanguine - if not a little bemused - at Lord Mandelson's departure, saying it is the UK's business, and the president remains excited about the state visit. But there is a fear among some that if Trump were dragged into the controversy and embarrassed at the press conference, then that could sour his mood – and the visit.\nThe Mandelson affair is not the only potential challenge. As one distinguished former British ambassador told me: \"On values and policies, we have fundamental differences with the Trump administration – on Nato, Ukraine, Middle East and China.\n\"The differences are more profound than at any time since World War Two.\"\nPerhaps the most acute difference that could overshadow the visit relates to the Middle East.\nNext week the UK is expected to formally recognise Palestinian statehood in an attempt to keep alive the idea of a so-called \"two state solution\". But the Americans are strongly opposed, as the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, made clear on Friday, emphasising his commitment \"to fight anti-Israel actions including unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state that rewards Hamas terrorism\".\nThere are also political risks for the prime minister. Underlying this state visit is an unspoken transaction: that it is worth giving Trump all those trimmings in order to help British interests, namely to reduce tariffs and foster investment partnerships.\nYet Trump is unpopular in the UK. A YouGov poll in July found only 16% of Britons surveyed say they have a positive view of him. The government will have to explain to voters why it believes this state visit is a price worth paying to try to grow the British economy.\nAmid these potential pitfalls lies a deeper, but less discussed risk from this state visit. That is: in its diplomatic game of cards, has the government played its King too explicitly for political purposes?\n\"The government have the convening power of the King and they have used it in a very transactional way, for example the brandishing of the King's letter in the Oval Office,\" said one royal source. \"They realise the Palace can draw people in, in a way that you can't in Whitehall. \"The problem in using the personality of the monarch and the institution of the monarchy is there is a risk that you cross a line and you ask someone who has to remain studiously non-political to transact a political act on behalf of the government.\"\nOfficial state visits by US presidents are rare. There have only ever been three: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and Trump in 2019. All other visits were official or informal. So this week's does matter.\nBut even if it passes off smoothly and gaffe-free questions may remain about its efficacy. \"This is very early in Trump's presidency,\" one diplomat said.\n\"Have we played this card too soon? What do we do for an encore?\"\nTop picture credits: Win McNamee/Getty Images, Neil Hall /EPA/Shutterstock and Hollie Adams, WPA Pool/Getty Images, Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Bloomberg via Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "title": "'You feel a bit invincible': Triathlete's warning to fellow students over signs of sepsis",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr70zr51rmeo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "A triathlete is ready to face life with no limbs after they were all amputated as she fought sepsis.\nCardiff University medical student Lily McGarry, from Jersey, believed she was experiencing a bout of \"freshers' flu\".\nBut after being taken to hospital, the 24-year-old suffered two heart attacks and fell into a coma, with the next three months a complete blank. The life-threatening condition, where the body's response to an infection damages tissues and organs is not yet clearly understood and can affect anyone, of any age, according to the UK Sepsis Trust. \"When you're young you think, as I did, that these kind of conditions don't affect you,\" said Lily. \"You feel a bit invincible, and you don't want to worry about your health because you've got a social life to live.\"\nDescribed by her friends as \"a fantastic sportswoman\", Lily was passionate about swimming, running and being at the beach. But as she lies in her bed at Cardiff's Llandough Hospital, she remembers the day her normal student lifestyle was turned upside down, and contemplates how she can return to an active lifestyle.\n\"I felt a bit under the weather, but I was still going about my daily life,\" she said. \"I was sat at home with my housemates at uni.\n\"Then I watched Gavin and Stacey all day sat on the sofa.\"\nThis was on 14 January, and she decided to go to bed at about 23:00, adding: \"I just thought I'd have a rest and sleep it off.\"\nBut as the night went on, Lily's condition deteriorated.\nShe added: \"My housemate saw my light was still on when she got up in the night, and came to see me. \"I was sick everywhere and had been incontinent.\"\nHer friends Lucy and Ella cleaned her up and took her to A&E, at which point she noticed a rash that was starting to spread on her body. Lily was taken to the resuscitation area, and was still not fully aware of the seriousness of her condition, adding: \"I was able to walk into A&E and so at that point I thought I'd just receive some antibiotics and go home the next day. \"But in resus I remember the consultant asking for my mum and dad's mobile numbers.\"\nApart from being in a room surrounded by doctors and nurses, she remembers very little after this, until about three months later in April. Lily did not even know she had suffered a cardiac arrest, and describes it as \"quite surreal\" finding out about this from a post her sister had written.\n\"I don't think I really realised the scale of what had happened until about May when I was starting to look at my body,\" she added. \"I've been told I quickly went into septic shock.\n\"My blood pressure was very low and within 24 hours I'd had two cardiac arrests and was diagnosed with meningococcal septicaemia.\"\nSepsis occurs when the body responds improperly to infection, causing the organs to work poorly. It can cause a dramatic drop in blood pressure and damage the lungs, kidneys, liver and other organs.\nAccording to UK Sepsis Trust, one of the key challenges in identifying sepsis is that it can present very differently in each patient.\nThere are six key symptoms to look out for:\nS - slurred speech or confusion\nE - extreme pain in muscles and joints\nP - passing no urine in a day\nS - severe breathlessness\nI - people saying \"it feels like I'm going to die\"\nS - skin that's mottled, discoloured or very pale\n\"I'm fortunate to have lost my limbs in an age where there's lots of technology,\" Lily said. She is considering devices such as hand cycles, adding: \"I've always liked swimming and being in the water and I'm really excited about the sense of freedom I'll have without gravity in the water.\n\"So I hope that can happen soon.\"\nLily will head back to Jersey in November, and is looking forward to seeing her grandparents, going to the beach and to \"recuperate and reflect on what's happened\".\nFriends and family are also raising money to help give her as many opportunities as possible, and she describes feeling emotional about support from Wales, Jersey and further afield. Housemate Ella Jennings described how compassionate and caring she is, and how Lily would go out of her way to help others.\n\"Since she's got poorly she's just that and more, she's so positive,\" Ella added.\n\"Every time I see her she's making more progress and thinking about the future, she's so determined. She's still the same Lily asking about everyone else and caring about everyone else.\n\"Honestly she blows my mind, every time I see her, she astounds me with her attitude and her outlook on life.\""

    "title": "How long can the UK afford the pension triple lock?",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wdgk7ggezo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "At a weekly ballet class in Wokingham, dancers glide elegantly through an intricate series of poses, making it look easy despite ranging in age from 50 to over 80.\nFigures released on Tuesday, suggesting retirees will likely benefit from a 4.7% increase in the state pension from next April, will add a spring to those dancers' steps.\nYet concerns remain. Glenys worries about those whose only income is the basic state pension.\n\"I do feel sorry for people that are struggling, if it's food or heat,\" she says.\nMeanwhile, former architect Mary says her children's generation are having to strive harder and for longer to afford to start a family or buy a home. \"My daughter's about to give birth, and she's beginning to contribute to a pension. But what it's going to be like for the new grandchild, I've no idea.\"\nGlenys and Mary's reflections show not only the success of the triple lock system used to increase pensions but also raises questions around its fairness and its sustainability.\nThe triple lock formula says that the state pension will rise in spring by the greater of 2.5%, the previous September's inflation rate, or the increase in average earnings registered over the previous summer.\nBecause the earnings figure published on Tuesday morning is almost certain to be the highest of those three, it is likely the state pension will go up by 4.7% in April.\nThe measure has helped to cut the number of pensioners living in poverty, but according to the minister who launched it, Sir Steve Webb, it's not job done yet. The UK's state pension is less generous than the average in rich countries, meaning we are more reliant on private savings. And the nature of the cost of living crisis of the past few years, centred on the staples like food and energy, has left those reliant on the state pension particularly stretched.\nIt could get worse for some pensioners. The triple lock means the new state pension - for those who reached pension age after April 2016 - is creeping closer to the £12,570 threshold at which tax becomes payable.\nThat threshold is set to be frozen until 2028, meaning people like former hairdresser Linda will soon likely end up paying income tax on their pension under current plans.\n\"You're given it in one hand and it's taken away in the other, so that's not a lot of good,\" she says.\n\"If they could raise the tax threshold, it would make a huge difference.\"\nThe state pension faces other issues. We are living longer and having fewer children, so the bill is booming and it is being footed by a falling share of the population.\nAlready, funding the state pension accounted for almost £140bn in the last financial year, making it the second biggest claim on the public purse after health spending. And the amount spent is vulnerable to the kind of extremes in inflation we've seen in recent years, meaning it now costs about three times as much as its architects originally reckoned.\nFuture sums threaten to be eyewatering. The government's own independent forecaster says that by 2070 the amount needed to fund the state pension will be equivalent to 7.7% of GDP - 50% higher than right now. That is quite an ask of taxpayers when other claims on the public purse are also projected to soar, in particular healthcare spending - largely for the same group of older Brits.\nAs the costs mount, many economists say the triple lock might disappear. Keeping it going means shifting an increasing amount of resources from younger generations, workers and business owners, to older ones.\nThe government has committed to keeping it in place for the rest of the parliament, but Pensions Minister Torsten Bell admitted in a previous role - as chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank that focuses on the plight of the lower paid - that the triple lock is a \"messy tool\".\nSo what should replace it? In his previous job, Bell touted a system of increases that was shielded from spikes in inflation. Webb, who acknowledges the triple lock can't continue \"infinitely\", has mentioned a system of getting the pension to a certain proportion of average earnings – and then maintaining that. Others have floated the idea of linking it to inflation or earnings increases. The question is whether politicians would do any of this. The scrutiny in the run-up to the last election on the triple lock, and the row over the winter fuel payment, underscores what a sensitive topic pensioners' finances are with voters.\nThat is not just the case with current retirees. Shortly after speaking to Linda, Glenys and Mary, we visited a board game night in Reading where players were mainly in their 20s and 30s. They pointed out that pensioners can still find it a struggle to afford the basics and, crucially, they themselves know that this is the scheme that they will have to rely on in some form.\nSmall wonder that most politicians shy away from the issue where they can.\nThere is an alternative, but not an enticing one. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that we'd have to work until 74 to keep a lid on state pension spending.\nNo-one said getting older was easy."

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly0qnnx5w5o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "Thousands of families are attempting to flee Gaza City as the Israeli military confirms it has begun ground operations that are part of its large-scale assault aimed at occupying the city. Lina al-Maghrebi, 32, a mother of three from the city's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood told the BBC she had resisted leaving her home - despite the danger - until she received a phone call from an Israeli officer ordering her to evacuate. \"I was forced to sell my jewellery to cover the cost of displacement and a tent,\" she said. \"It took us 10 hours to reach Khan Younis, and we paid 3,500 shekels (£735) for the ride. The line of cars and trucks seemed endless.\"\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a \"powerful operation\" had been launched in Gaza City, which he described as Hamas's last major stronghold.\nThe Israeli military has designated al-Rashid coastal road as the only permitted route for civilians to use to evacuate. Many have described severe congestion, endless queues of cars and trucks, and long delays, with families stranded on the roadside while airstrikes continue overhead.\nNivin Imad al-Din, 38, a mother of five, said she fled south after Israeli warplanes dropped evacuation leaflets in her neighbourhood, though her husband refused to leave their home.\n\"I couldn't take my furniture with me because I couldn't afford the cost of a large truck,\" she explained. \"Leaving everything behind was the hardest decision I've ever made.\"\nThe cost of displacement has surged far beyond the reach of most households. Residents said renting a small truck now costs around 3,000 shekels (£630), while a tent for five people sells for about 4,000 shekels (£840). With most families deprived of income since the war began, some are forced to walk for miles or remain in their homes despite the risks.\nOvernight into Tuesday, Israeli warplanes carried out a wave of heavy airstrikes across Gaza City, with concentrated bombardment on the central al-Daraj neighbourhood, the Beach refugee camp in the west, and Sheikh Radwan in the north.\nThe attacks were accompanied by artillery fire, drone fire and helicopter gunship activity. The Israel Defense Forces said it was \"gradually\" moving into Gaza City as part of the \"next phase\" of its offensive.\nIt said air and ground forces would be part of this next stage of the military's operation, with the number of troops increasing day-by-day.\nResidents described the overnight strikes as \"hell\". Ghazi al-Aloul, a displaced resident from northern Gaza, told the BBC he is now sleeping at the entrance of al-Quds Hospital in Tel al-Hawa, southwest Gaza. \"I did not choose this,\" he said. \"I was forced after leaving the home where my family and I had been sheltering for nearly a month after fleeing the north\".\n\"The bombardment has been insane for hours, and the army is threatening to demolish several residential buildings in the area.\" Sami Abu Dalal, from al-Daraj in central Gaza, described the night as \"extremely difficult\".\n\"Whole residential blocks were levelled on top of their inhabitants, leaving many dead, missing, or injured,\" he said.\nHe said Israel was advancing on three fronts - and was accompanied by the use of booby-trapped vehicles, intense airstrikes, and heavy shelling. Meanwhile, Apache helicopters hovered over different parts of the city, firing continuously.\nIsrael's ramped up offensive comes as a United Nations commission of inquiry have released a report that says Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza - Israel categorically rejected the report."

There were people coming and going all day,\" explains the Bank of England Museum's curator, Jenni Adam.\n\"And immediately they were greeted with this sense of grandeur along with lots and lots of messages about what's happening in this site.\"\nOne hundred years ago work began to rebuild the Bank of England - a place which had started as a townhouse in the 1700s and expanded over subsequent centuries.\nTo mark this centenary a new exhibition has begun in the bank's museum revealing more about what can be found inside one of Britain's most secure buildings.\nAhead of its opening the BBC was given a rare look inside the bank itself, where some of the country's key financial decisions are made and which houses some 400,000 bars of gold in its basement vaults.\nThe bank was first granted a Royal Charter in 1694 when it was \"founded for the use and benefit of the public as a way to manage the national debt and maintain stable finances in Britain\", says Ms Adam.\nIt proved to be a huge success and by 1734 had moved to its current position in Threadneedle Street, with the premises becoming grander and slowly swallowing up surrounding land to cover a three-and-a-half acre (14,000 sq m) site within a windowless wall.\nVarious renowned architects worked on the bank including Sir John Soane in the 1800s, with his building considered one the jewels of the City.\nHowever, by the first decades of the 20th Century, Soane's magnificent work was no longer proving fit for purpose.\n\"By the First World War the staff at the bank had gone from about 1,200 in 1914 to around 4,000 by 1918 and it was clear that there was a real capacity problem,\" says Ms Adam. \"It was doing a colossal job of managing an expensive national debt among many different aspects so it was decided to demolish and rebuild.\"\nDespite efforts to retain much of its historic character, the 14-year project proved controversial with one architectural expert branding the demolition \"the greatest architectural crime to befall London in the 20th Century\".\nEven so, upon its completion in 1939 the project led by chief architect Sir Herbert Baker had cost a total of £5m - the equivalent of nearly £285m today - with no expense spared in the creation of the country's central bank.\nEvidence of such wealth can be seen throughout a development which rises seven floors high and three below.\nOn the ground floor, mosaics by acclaimed Russian artist Boris Anrep spread along a maze of domed grey and black corridors, with figures and sculptures covering the fixtures and fittings throughout.\nGolden lions - symbolising security - pop up across the space, from specially designed lighting to staircase bannisters, while even the door handles are miniature recreations of Mercury, the Roman deity of communication and finance. \"There's a real blend of modern and ancient. It gives you the sense that even though this building is relatively new, it's been here forever,\" explains Ms Adam.\n\"There's a long legacy, a long heritage. You can trust it, it's going to stick around.\"\nThere is also a sign of an even older legacy at the bottom of one long spiralling staircase, where a Roman mosaic that was discovered in the 1930s remains on display.\nWith grand banking halls based on those from Soane's building hidden off the corridor, occasional echoing thuds and bangs are the main reminder of the working nature of the building.\nThis enterprise also carries on up another set of staircases but in a very different, almost regal atmosphere.\nOne space, the first floor anteroom, is lined with red and gold silk, with centuries-old paintings hanging on the walls and an elaborately decorative fireplace standing beside a huge floor-to-ceiling window.\nLeading off it are a thick set of wooden double-doors that head into a plush pale blue octagonal room where a portrait of a past governor glares down upon a reproduction of a room created in the 1780s.\nWithout the microphones placed around a curving table and two TV screens, few would consider this somewhere where discussions are held each month that have ramifications for millions of people.\n\"This is where to the present day, the bank's monetary policy committee meets to make decisions about rates as part of the bank's remit to manage inflation.\n\"That's why you want the double doors to make sure that nobody is listening into these very important market sensitive conversations,\" Ms Adam explains.\nThe feel of a grand old building spotted with hints of modernity continues around the floor, with many of the stone elements from the previous bank-like fireplaces and columns reused by Baker.\nThrough another set of double doors is the court room, where a branded lectern stands in front of an 18th Century fireplace beneath an elaborate green ceiling and walls lined with gold.\nSilhouettes of monarchs from across the lifetime of the bank line the room, while gilded griffins protect piles of gold above the doorways. A wind vane also swings mechanically on one wall recalling a time when London's port was almost on the bank's doorstep and was such a key element of the city's economy.\n\"There's just lots of the symbolism of money and finance throughout the space... and gild as far as the eye can see,\" adds the museum curator.\nThe need for tight security means that tours of the building are incredibly rare. The only sight of any of the gold are the two bars held within the museum that are owned by the bank itself.\nIt's why Ms Adam says she's so pleased to be able to put on an exhibition to \"open up the architecture\" and give people an idea of what's inside.\n\"I've been working in the bank for 15 years and when you come in here every day, it becomes normal,\" she says.\n\"However, every so often you do go around and think 'this is so spectacular' - and there's just so many stories and details to share.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4y2ejlpdjo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "People I speak to at the top of government acknowledge the last few weeks have been dreadful for them and they are kicking themselves about the mistakes they have made.\nThe latest twist, the departure of another senior aide to the prime minister, after the leaking of sexually explicit messages from nearly a decade ago, is seen by some in government as symptomatic of the factional acrimony reverberating through Labour.\nBut there is something else going on here which amplifies the jitters within Labour and causes contortions and anguish for others here at Westminster.\nYou can sum it up in a word: Reform.\nThey are frightening their rivals right now.\nTheir comfortable and now sustained over months lead in the opinion polls, alongside their habit of demonstrating momentum – the defection of Conservative shadow minister Danny Kruger being the latest case in point - is accelerating the difficult questions and conundrums the other parties wrestle with.\nFor Labour, the fear that runs to their bones is bequeathing power to an outfit they loathe, Reform UK.\nFor the Conservatives, frequently leaking defectors to Nigel Farage, every one sharpens the existential questions they confront.\nAnd for the Liberal Democrats, they have a record breaking 72 MPs but are frustrated at a perceived lack of attention, amid the din elsewhere.\nThose close to the prime minister are candid about how rough things have been for them and the task they have winning back the trust of so many of their MPs.\n\"We're not oblivious to the scale of the problem. We were aware of it before the summer, but the last two weeks have made it more difficult,\" is how one senior figure put it.\nAnother senior figure tells me Sir Keir Starmer's speech to the Labour Party Conference in a fortnight's time \"will leave people in absolutely no doubt at all what he stands for and what the government stands for\".\nThat, in itself, is a tacit acknowledgement that from No10's point of view nowhere near enough people could say what he stands for now.\nThe argument we are likely to hear is being rehearsed already: the prime minister told Channel 4 News that he has every intention of sticking around as Labour's leader, and made the case for why:\n\"I am absolutely determined to lead in this fight of our times between renewal, the patriotic cause of the Labour Party and the division and toxic chaos and decline that would come under Reform.\"\nWhat, then, of Kemi Badenoch and the Conservative Party?\nMy phone rings and it is a former Conservative cabinet minister on the other end.\nThey say it is \"another unsurprising exit\" and describe Kruger as \"impossible\" and an \"ideologue\".\nBut when I bump into another former Conservative cabinet minister they are more pensive at what they fear the defection says about the Tories.\nAs the Conservatives also approach their annual conference, they confront a moment of peril greater than any in their modern history.\nAnd then there is Reform UK.\nMake no mistake, they face colossal questions:\nJust for a start, can they build the campaigning infrastructure, the local parties, the list of vetted candidates, the policy heft and attract the talent to present themselves as a viable alternative government?\nThen there is the cranking up of scrutiny they will now face, such as this story from the BBC's Billy Kenber and Phil Kemp.\nThey are taking on all of this and a lot more in the blink of an eye and it is far from certain it is do-able.\nBut with each passing month, their opponents treat with increasing credibility the possibility it could happen.\nWhat we are witnessing, so often, in other parties right now is their reaction to that."

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xrge1prpyo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "Mark Ronson is in trouble.\nIt's summer 1998, and he's hunched over the turntables at New York's venerable VIP bar, Spy.\nRonson is there to DJ for Prince, the Purple pipsqueak of funk. It's going well, until he pulls Michael Jackson's Off The Wall from its sleeve, ready to drop the 1979 disco classic Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough.\nSuddenly, someone's tugging at his arm. It's the rapper Q-Tip, and there's an uncommon urgency to his voice as he shouts: \"No! You can't play that. Not in front of Prince!\"\nRemembering the star's rivalry with Jackson in the 1980s, Ronson whips the record off the decks. But that leaves him with a problem.\n\"At this point there's only 20 seconds left [of the previous song]. I pull another record out, but the tempos don't match and I flub the mix.\"\nRonson glances over to the VIP area, where Prince is holding court in a plush throne.\n\"And he's glaring down at me like, 'What is this train wreck?'\n\"It was slightly humiliating.\"\nLuckily, train wrecks were a rarity. Long before he was an Oscar-winning hitmaker for Lady Gaga and Amy Winehouse, Ronson was one of New York's most in-demand DJs.\nA nocturnal animal, he'd bait his prey with crates of vinyl, swooping in for the kill with a perfectly-timed drop of AC/DC's Back In Black or Busta Rhymes' Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See.\n\"I could walk into any room and, almost like the Terminator, scan the crowd and be like, 'I know what the first three records are',\" he says.\nThat's as close to boastfulness as Ronson gets. He's so laid-back it's almost comical, speaking in a perpetually sleepy drawl, like the Big Lebowski of music.\nWe meet in Notting Hill's Music and Video Exchange – the shop that kick-started his record collection – and it's only when he starts rifling through the racks that the 50-year-old comes to life.\n\"This one changed my life,\" he says, pulling out a dog-eared copy of Pete Rock's They Reminisce Over You.\n\"Oh, and here's Salt-N-Pepa's Shoop… Now, that's my song!\"\nA similar enthusiasm permeates Ronson's new memoir, Night People, which concentrates on the 1990s DJ career that saw him playing for everyone from Jay-Z to Mariah Carey.\n\"She had very specific songs she wanted to hear,\" he recalls. \"There was a great R&B record called Say I'm Your Number One, by Princess, that she'd always request.\n\"Eventually, I just knew to play it as soon as I saw her, to save her a trip to the booth.\"\nWhen he pitched the book, which ends long before his successes with Winehouse on Back To Black and Bruno Mars on Uptown Funk, \"people were scratching their heads\", Ronson admits.\n\"They were like, 'Oh right, so you want to write about the time before the thing we know you for?'\"\nBut he stuck to his guns. The memoir is a heartfelt love letter to a bygone era, inspired by the death of his close friend and contemporary DJ Blu Jemz in 2018.\n\"I was just staring at all the records [we used to play] on my shelf, thinking about how each one was so evocative of a memory and a moment in time.\n\"It's arguably the last time New York was the apex of hip-hop both creatively and commercially - A Tribe Called Quest, Wu-Tang, Biggie Smalls, Lil' Kim, Busta Rhymes... all of it. And they were out in the clubs every night.\"\nAnother figure who loomed over the scene was P Diddy, aka Sean Combs, who's currently awaiting sentencing in New York after being found guilty on two counts of transportation for the purposes of prostitution.\nDiddy gave Ronson one of his big breaks, hiring him to play at A-list events, including his 29th birthday party, after tipping the DJ with a $100 bill containing his phone number.\n\"It's undeniable that the way he picked me for certain gigs elevated my star,\" says Ronson, calling the accusations against Diddy \"horrific\".\n\"I had no idea of anything like that going on,\" he says, acknowledging the musician \"wielded a tremendous amount of power and cachet\" in New York.\n\"But in the five years I DJ'd for him, I doubt he spoke more than five sentences to me. \"He was mostly out there dancing and I knew if he was dancing, no-one was gonna yell at me.\"\nAt the outset, Ronson wanted his book to capture the seediness of 90s club culture, where he'd play \"night in, night out for $100\" while \"cokehead club owners shouted at me for not playing enough Madonna\".\nAs he wrote, another story also emerged.\nRonson was born in London to jewellery designer Ann Dexter-Jones and music publisher Laurence Ronson. Their house in St John's Wood was a frequent haunt for actors and musicians, including Keith Moon and Robin Williams.\n\"My parents had crazy parties all the time,\" he recalls. \"Fifty or 60 slightly cracked people, smoking, drinking, having a great time.\"\nThe aftermath was drastically different. In the book, he writes of \"angry crescendos and heavy silences\" from his parents' bedroom, which instilled a \"constant watchfulness that became instinct before I understood why\".\nLater in life, DJing fulfilled a \"need for control\" that stemmed from that early instability.\n\"It wasn't always the greatest way to grow up for a kid, and there was something about the DJ booth that was incredibly comforting.\n\"It's like I'm an army of one. I make all the rules. It's a refuge, in a way.\"\nLearning to navigate delicate situations also helped Ronson's career as a producer.\nThere's an almost too-perfect example in Lady Gaga's documentary Five Foot Two where, arriving for a recording session, the star crashes into Ronson's car.\nMortified, she enters the studio in a garbled flurry of apologies. Ronson simply stretches out his arms for a conciliatory hug.\n\"If you have a problem, I wish you'd just say it to my face instead of my bumper,\" he deadpans.\nThe situation is immediately defused.\nReminded of the scene, he says: \"I remember working on that record [2016's Joanne] pretty well, and Lady Gaga is probably one of the most chased, hounded, paparazzi-ed people you could imagine.\n\"Sometimes we'd slam the door and there'd be 20 people on the other side taking pictures. So my role is just to shut out the outside world [and] make the artist feel relaxed and comfortable at all times.\n\"Even when they've trashed your car.\"\nHis unflappability also helped along Winehouse's Back To Black, bringing focus to a feverish creative streak.\n\"I remember some of my friends saying, 'Oh, you're working with Amy? Good luck. She's been working on this album for three years',\" he recalls.\n\"But when we got in the studio, she was such a fireball of inspiration. We demoed three or four songs, we wrote Back to Black, she wrote Rehab... All these things in five days. It's a lot of incredible memories.\"\nOther songs took longer. Uptown Funk needed seven months. Dua Lipa's Barbie anthem Dance The Night was rewritten \"five or six times with different hooks\".\nBut those are stories for another time... and \"maybe\" a second volume of Ronson's memoir.\nRight now, though, I've lost him to the record store's vinyl bins, picking out old favourites by the Stone Roses, Brand New Heavies and Cypress Hill - and prompting a moment of introspection.\n\"There are people who enjoy a night out and then there are night people,\" he decides.\n\"I was definitely the latter... but I had no idea where it would take me.\""

    "content": "A Kenyan High Court has issued an arrest warrant for a British national suspected of murdering a 21-year-old woman more than a decade ago.\nAgnes Wanjiru was killed in March 2012 and her body later found in a septic tank of a hotel in the central garrison town of Nanyuki nearly three months after she had allegedly spent an evening partying with British soldiers.\nJustice Alexander Muteti said prosecutors had provided sufficient evidence to request that the suspect appear before a Kenyan court for trial.\nThe lawyer representing Ms Wanjiru's family, Kamau Mbiu, told the BBC the ruling paved the way for proceedings to start for the suspect's extradition from the UK.\n\"We welcome it, but we urge greater transparency, as this remains a matter of public interest,\" Mr Mbiu said.\nThe judge directed that the identities of the accused and witnesses not be published, saying this was necessary in order to protect the integrity of the trial.\nIn a statement, a UK government spokesperson said: \"Our thoughts remain with the family of Agnes Wanjiru and we remain absolutely committed to helping them secure justice.\"\nThe spokesperson said no further comment would be made at this stage because of the ongoing legal proceedings. The UK's Ministry of Defence has previously said it is co-operating with the Kenyan investigation into the case, which has caused outrage in the East African nation.\nThe family of Ms Wanjiru, who left behind a young daughter, have long been fighting for justice.\nThey live in Nanyuki, which is close to the British Army Training Unit Kenya (Batuk) - some 200km (125 miles) north of the capital, Nairobi.\nMs Wanjiru's niece, Esther Njoki, told the BBC that the warrant was \"a bitter-sweet moment\", noting the extradition process could take time. The prosecution told the court that witnesses currently based in the UK would be made available for the trial, ensuring that it could proceed.\nThe family's UK-based legal representative, Tessa Gregory, said it now called \"upon the British government to do everything in its power to ensure that the accused can be extradited and face trial in Kenya as soon as possible\".\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7dzmyjrjzo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "More than 13,000 heroin and opioid deaths have been missed off official statistics in England and Wales, raising concerns about the impact on the government's approach to tackling addiction.\nResearch from King's College London, shared exclusively with BBC News, found that there were 39,232 opioid-related deaths between 2011 and 2022, more than 50% higher than previously known.\nThe error has been blamed on the government's official statistics body not having access to post-mortem reports or toxicology results.\nData on specific drug deaths is a major driver of policy and it is understood the government is now working with coroners to improve the reporting of deaths.\nThe number of opioid deaths per million people in England and Wales has almost doubled since 2012, but this new study means the scale of the problem is likely to be even greater.\nResearchers from the National Programme on Substance Use Mortality at King's used data from coroners' reports to calculate a more accurate estimate of opioid-related deaths.\nOpioids include drugs such as heroin that come from the opium poppy plant, as well as synthetically-made substances like fentanyl.\nThe Liberal Democrats have said the government needs to \"urgently investigate\" how the error was made.\nThe reliability of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) data relies on coroners naming specific substances on death certificates, something which often does not happen.\nSpecific substances such as heroin are instead sometimes only included on more detailed post-mortem reports or toxicology results, which the ONS does not have access to.\nGovernment data on overall drug deaths, which does not name specific substances, is not affected by the error, but ministers' decision-making is generally influenced by the more granular statistics.\nThe body that oversees police commissioners says correct data on opioid deaths could have led to more funding and better treatment for front-line services such as police forces and public health.\nBen was 27 when he died from a heroin overdose in 2018, but his death was ruled as \"misadventure\" and was never included on the official opioid death statistics.\nHis addiction began with cannabis when he was a teenager and progressed to using aerosols and eventually heroin.\n\"Ben was just a very kind person. We miss him, we all miss him every day,\" said his mother Hilary.\nAt one point, she said Ben appeared to \"turn a corner\".\nHe was awarded a place in a rehab facility, but shortly before he was set to move in, Hilary got the phone call she had always dreaded.\n\"I think what happened is, he wasn't using,\" she said. \"They think probably about three months and his tolerance had gone down.\"\nBen's family believe that different treatment and support for drug addicts could have helped him.\nDr Caroline Copeland, who led the new research, said drug policies \"will not have the desired impact unless the true scale of the problem is known\".\nShe added: \"We need to alert coroners to the impact that not naming specific drugs as the cause of death has on the planning and funding of public health policies.\"\nThe research, which has been peer-reviewed and published in the International Journal of Drug Policy, focused specifically on opioid deaths, but similar undercounts are thought to exist in data about deaths from other drugs too.\nFurther work by King's College London has found that 2,482 cocaine-related deaths have also been missed off ONS statistics over the last 10 years.\nDavid Sidwick, the drugs lead for the National Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, told the BBC the organisation would \"be pushing hard\" for more treatment funding, in light of the faulty statistics.\nMr Sidwick, who is also a Conservative police and crime commissioner, said more accurate data would lead to \"better decisions about the amount of funding required for treatment\" and suggested \"new treatment methods\" such as buprenorphine, a monthly injection that can help heroin users overcome addiction. Helen Morgan, the Liberal Democrat health spokesperson, said: \"I dread to think of the lives that may have been lost due to damaging policies based on faulty stats.\"\nShe added: \"The government now needs to step up, launch an investigation and ensure that the ONS is given access to the data it needs so that it can never make this error again.\"\nThe ONS, which helped with the research, said it had warned that \"the information provided by coroners on death registrations can lack detail\" on the specific drugs involved.\nA spokesperson added: \"The more detail coroners can provide about specific drugs relevant to a death will help further improve these statistics to inform the UK government's drug strategy.\"\nThe flaw in the ONS system is not present in Scotland, where there are no coroners and where National Records Scotland (NRS) is responsible for collating official statistics.\nUnlike the ONS, the NRS does receive more detailed pathology reports, but differences in how deaths are reported across the UK make it difficult to compare.\nThe opioid undercounting raises further questions about the under-fire ONS, which has been accused of failing on several statistical fronts recently.\nData sets on job markets and immigration have been criticised and earlier this year a government review said the ONS had \"deep-seated\" issues which needed tackling.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \"We continue to work with partners across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use, ensure more people receive timely treatment and support, and make our streets and communities safer.\"\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond."

    "content": "A self-styled \"African tribe\" has been evicted from privately-owned land in the Scottish Borders - only to set up a new camp just metres away.\nFive sheriff officers entered the makeshift encampment in woodland near Jedburgh at 08:00 while the three members of the self-proclaimed Kingdom of Kubala group were still asleep.\nThe group packed up their belongings and moved them the short distance to a new site in the woodland, on the other side of a wire fence.\nThe \"tribe\" have been living in the wood for several weeks despite formal attempts to remove them from the land.\nThe eviction order was issued by Sheriff Peter Paterson last week after the group ignored a previous instruction to leave their encampment.\nThey said they were reclaiming land that was stolen from their ancestors 400 years ago - but the local council said they were breaking the law.\nThe group have a growing online presence, with more than 100,000 followers on TikTok and Facebook, and have received worldwide media attention.\nGhanaian Kofi Offeh, 36, and Jean Gasho, 42, who is originally from Zimbabwe, first arrived in the Jedburgh area in the spring.\nDescribing themselves as King Atehehe and Queen Nandi, they set up camp on a hillside above the town in the Scottish Borders.\nThey were joined by \"handmaiden\" Kaura Taylor, from Texas, who calls herself Asnat.\nThe eviction was carried out by sheriff officers, who were supported by four police officers, on Tuesday morning.\nShouting could be heard from the woods as they woke them.\nThe officials remained on site for about 90 minutes, by which time the tribe's tents had been dismantled and their possessions packed up.\nThe group then set up a new camp just metres away on the other side a of a wire fence. They would not directly comment when asked by BBC Scotland what had happened.\nThe group claimed ancestral rights to land and insisted that the Kingdom of Kubala had been born.\nScottish Borders Council initially evicted the trio from the hillside site above Jedburgh in July.\nBut rather than leave the area, they moved about a mile further out of town to a woodland next to an industrial estate.\nMr Offeh previously said he was \"not afraid\" of the warrant for their eviction.\nThe land's owners, David and Mary Palmer, successfully applied to the courts for the tribe to be evicted.\nHowever, Scottish Borders Council said they had failed to comply with an order to leave the land by 17:00 on Monday.\nJedburgh councillor Scott Hamilton said last week that the group were breaking the law by taking up residence on someone else's land.\nHe said the landowner had been left with \"no option\" but to seek an order from the sheriff.\nMr Hamilton, deputy leader of the council, said it was disappointing - but not surprising - that the group had ignored the ultimatum to leave the site.\n\"They have rebuffed every opportunity to engage with us,\" he said.\n\"We can help them, but we won't sit back and let them break the law.\""

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrq5049j0yo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "The number of people who received winter fuel payments plunged to 1.3 million following controversial cuts by the government, new figures have revealed.\nIn previous years, about 11 million people in England, Wales and Scotland received the payment, which helps pensioners cover winter energy bills.\nBut a Treasury decision to means-test the payment led to the much lower number of recipients last year, new official figures from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) show.\nThat policy has now been scrapped, with a U-turn by the chancellor in June meaning that the vast majority of pensioners will again get the payment - worth up to about £300 per household - this coming winter.\nThe winter fuel payment was previously paid to all pensioners to help with energy costs during the coldest period of the year.\nBut in July 2024, the government said future payments in England and Wales would go only to those on low incomes who received specified benefits such as pension credit. In Scotland, ministers planned to mitigate some of those cuts.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said the move was needed owing to the state of the public finances. The policy's impact on different areas of the country is revealed in the newly-published figures.\nIn areas with a higher proportion of low-income pensioners, many still received the winter fuel payment. In the Tower Hamlets area of London, some 49% of pensioners still received the payment.\nWhereas in Hart, in Hampshire, and Wokingham, in Berkshire, only 5% received it, compared with an England and Wales average of 13%.\nFollowing widespread anger and a backlash from some Labour MPs who blamed the policy for their party's poor showing in local elections in May, Reeves announced a partial reversal.\nPensioners with an annual income of £35,000 or less will now be eligible for the payment, and will receive a letter about it in October or November. It means more than three-quarters of pensioners will receive the help this winter. This policy will be matched by the Scottish government.\nThe winter fuel payment in England and Wales is worth £200 for people of state pension age up to 79-years-old. People aged 80 or older receive £300.\nIn Scotland this coming winter, the payment will be increased in line with inflation, which charts rising prices, so will be worth either £203.40 or £305.10 per household.\nEnergy bills will rise by 2% in October, under energy regulator Ofgem's price cap, unless a household is on a fixed deal.\nThe latest data comes as pensioners were also given a strong hint about the likely rise in the state pension next April. A government spokesman said nine million pensioners would receive the payment this winter, and ministers had also reaffirmed their commitment to the triple lock.\n\"And thanks to our efforts to boost pension credit take up, over 57,000 extra pensioner households were awarded the benefit, worth on average £4,300 a year,\" he said."

    "content": "A long-awaited \"Hillsborough Law\" bill will force public officials to tell the truth during investigations into major disasters.\nThe news has been welcomed by campaigners, who had feared the legislation was going to be watered down. The landmark Public Office (Accountability) Bill will force public bodies to cooperate with investigations into major disasters or potentially face criminal sanctions, as well as provide legal funding to those affected by state-related disasters.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who had previously pledged to bring in the law by the 36th anniversary of the 1989 disaster, said he was \"humbled\" by what the families had achieved.\n\"Thank you to the families and campaigners that for years and years and years never gave up on fighting for justice and truth and their determination to deliver a Hillsborough Law is why we're here today,\" he said.\nSir Keir continued: \"Today is an important day having known the families for 10 years and it is humbling to see what they have achieved after an unimaginable loss.\"\nHe said he had wanted the bill to be introduced earlier but: \"In the end I decided it was better to get it right and I've discussed it with the families here today and I do think it is right to have got the law into place that they are welcoming of it.\n\"And they know it will serve thousands upon thousands of people they will never meet, who will not have to go through what they have gone through.\n\"The extra work we've done has allowed us to get it right.\"\nHe added: \"We are not going to allow it to be watered down – I've made that commitment to the families as soon as possible to make sure no one suffers injustice.\"\nThe bill will be introduced to Parliament on Tuesday to begin its journey towards becoming law.\nThe government has confirmed a new professional and legal \"duty of candour\" will be part of the bill, meaning public officials would have to act with honesty and integrity at all times and would face criminal sanctions if they breached it.\nMargaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son James died at Hillsborough, said she was hopeful the new law \"will mean no-one will ever have to suffer like we did\".\nThe disaster, during the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the football ground in Sheffield on 15 April 1989, led to the deaths of 97 football fans.\nThe government said the new legislation would \"end the culture of cover-ups\" and learn lessons from wider disasters including the Grenfell Tower fire and the Post Office Horizon and infected blood scandals.\nMs Aspinall said: \"It's been a long journey to get here. I am so grateful to the prime minister for fulfilling his promise to me.\"\nSir Keir praised Ms Aspinall's \"courage\" and \"the strength of all the Hillsborough families and survivors\" in their long campaign for justice.\nHe said the new legislation would change \"the balance of power in Britain\" to ensure the state could \"never hide from the people it is supposed to serve\".\n\"Make no mistake, this a law for the 97, but it is also a law for the subpostmasters who suffered because of the Horizon scandal, the victims of infected blood, and those who died in the terrible Grenfell Tower fire,\" he said.\nCharlotte Hennessy, whose 29-year-old father Jimmy died at Hillsborough, said the campaign for the law had been \"really tough\".\n\"It has taken a lot of negotiation, blood, sweat and tears, late nights, meetings after meetings, reading a draft and saying 'no',\" she said.\n\"The duty of candour was the biggest barrier we had - it's important to note current laws such as perjury only apply to criminal cases.\"\nMs Hennessy said her family only became aware of exactly what happened to her father - a plasterer from Ellesmere Port, Cheshire - after the Hillsborough Independent Panel report.\n\"I didn't know the truth of what happened to my dad until 25 years later. When people say 'are they still going on about it?' - I've only known the truth for 13 of the last 36 years.\"\nOne of the bill's architects, Elkan Abrahamson of law firm Broudie Jackson Canter, said there was still some way to go before it became law.\n\"We will now scrutinise the bill as it makes its passage through parliament, so we're not quite there yet,\" he said.\n\"But today is still a momentous step, owed entirely to the persistence of campaigners and their refusal to give up. \"The Hillsborough Law will transform the face of British justice.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1kwmjxwpkxo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "The Champions League is back, but who will get their hands on the famous old trophy this season?\nHolders Paris St-Germain are one of 36 teams who begin the league phase this week, including six English sides - a record number for any country in the competition.\nStarting on Tuesday, there are a total of 189 games to be played, including the final at Budapest's Puskas Arena next May.\nWe have asked some of BBC Sport's expert pundits, commentators and journalists who they think will lift the trophy in Hungary, as well as who will go furthest out of Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur.\nThey have also picked their surprise package, and the player they are most looking forward to watching.\nAnd you can vote for who you think will be the winners below.\nDon't forget the BBC will again show highlights of the Champions League this season.\nFrom 22:00 BST on the Wednesday of Champions League weeks, there will be match-by-match highlights available on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app, plus a special Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One at 22:40.\nThis week there will also be be a highlights show on Thursday on BBC Two at 23:00.\nThis is the 71st edition of Europe's elite club competition and the 34th since it was renamed the Champions League in 1992. Paris St-Germain won last season's tournament - the first to be held using a new expanded format with a 36-team league phase\nBBC's chief football writer Phil McNulty: My pick to win it are Liverpool, purely on the basis of the huge strengthening they have carried out this summer. Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak are two high-class players who are Champions League-ready.\nThe vagaries of the new league system last season saw Liverpool meet eventual winners PSG in the last 16, where they lost on penalties at Anfield.\nIf Liverpool reach the knockout phase, which they surely will, then the Anfield factor grows with every game.\nPSG will be the big danger once again, a superb side who deserve the status as the best team in Europe, while Real Madrid come into every Champions League conversation as potential winners.\nBBC's senior football correspondent Sami Mokbel: I'm going for Liverpool. Four wins from four in the Premier League and they haven't even nearly hit top gear yet. Oh, and Isak is waiting in the wings. Arne Slot's side are the team to beat.\nFormer Germany midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger: Real are usually the club with the strongest mentality in this competition, but PSG have to be one of the favourites and Liverpool are too, given that they had such a good Premier League season then invested so much in their squad.\nThose two teams come immediately to mind when I think about who will play in the final, and if I have to pick one to win it then I will go with Liverpool. Their squad depth is excellent, the quality was already there and now they have got Isak up front as well.\nBBC Radio 5 Live football correspondent John Murray: When a team wins Europe's richest league at a comparative canter then spends the best part of half a billion pounds on new players, while at the same time securing the services of two of the club's greatest servants, it's difficult to tip anyone other than Liverpool.\nLast season they lost out only narrowly to the eventual winners in a penalty shootout. It would be a tremendous prospect if this season Liverpool and PSG were to make it all the way to the final in Budapest.\nMatch of the Day commentator Steve Wilson: Tipping Real Madrid to win the Champions League is hardly the work of a soothsayer, but you are not likely to be far wrong. I thought Xabi Alonso did some interesting things with his squad in the Club World Cup - and getting Arda Guler more involved can only be a good thing. His progress was held back by the affection everyone at the Bernabeu had for Luka Modric, now he has licence to really spread his wings.\nThe Observer football correspondent Rory Smith: It's been a frankly unacceptable one season since Real Madrid won the trophy the club sees as its birthright, and Alonso's main task as manager is to put that right. Real are never the most coherent team in Europe, but they have more individual talent than anyone, and often that is what matters.\nFormer England captain Steph Houghton: I am backing PSG to win it again. They are a young squad that has experienced winning already, plus they are athletic and forward thinking.\nFormer Scotland winger Pat Nevin: For a change, I went with my head over my heart. I love PSG and the way they play, and the way they have changed the way football is being played now with their attacking attitude. I also love that they love their wingers!\nSpanish football expert Guillem Balague: I feel PSG have started a new era of success that has to do with using cleverly the predominant model of our times - positional football - mixed with quality, clear leadership and top players in each position. Barcelona will be close, but I'm not sure they will sort out their defensive deficiencies.\nBBC Champions League analyst Stephen Warnock: I think Barcelona will win it - and I am going with Lamine Yamal to be the tournament's star player.\nFormer Arsenal defender Matt Upson: I have gone for Barcelona, who are a young team that have grown from the experience of their cracking run to the semi-finals last season.\nThey were very unlucky not to make the final, and played brilliantly against Inter Milan - they just got exposed by a really rigid Inter team that had a way of playing and did what it said on the tin. But Barca will have learned from that.\nThe club appears a little bit unstable off the pitch at the moment but on it they have a nice balance of special young talent and know-how - with the likes of Robert Lewandowski to come on and impact games.\nParis St-Germain trophy parade along the Champs-Elysees\nItalian football expert Nicky Bandini: I'll go with Liverpool. Predicting these things at the start is always a bit of guesswork - winning the Champions League comes down to fitness and form in key moments. PSG only took four points from their first five group games last season, then became a juggernaut by the spring.\nBut Liverpool were good enough to have won it last season - PSG needed a shootout to beat them after all - and spent almost half a billion pounds strengthening again. Hugo Ekitike, Wirtz, Isak - these are all players who can decide games when it matters. They also weren't involved in the Club World Cup over the summer. We're already seeing fatigue and injury catch up to some who were, so I think that may be a factor this season.\nFormer Arsenal forward Theo Walcott: I am not just saying this because I am Arsenal, but I do feel that if they had someone like Viktor Gyokeres in the PSG semi-final they lost last season, then they would have won it. When you create danger and put a ball into certain areas, Gyokeres is going to be there. He is that kind of old-school centre-forward that is going to make a difference for them in a lot of games this season. Arsenal are not going to draw as many games in the Premier League, and he is so equipped for the Champions League knockout ties as well.\nAdd that to the personnel that Arsenal already have, and how strong they are defensively, and that's why I am backing them to win it.\nBBC Champions League analyst Nedum Onuoha: It's tough to bet against Real Madrid. Last year was one of the worst displays we have seen from them in this competition and they still made it to the knockout stage. Alonso has come in with a new structure, and their new signings will make a difference for them.\nAI and Opta's 'Supercomputer': We also asked AI's opinion on who will win the Champions League, and included the calculations that Opta's 'Supercomputer' came up with too.\nThe AI prediction was generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict the Champions League winners for the 2025-26 season' and it went for Liverpool.\nOpta's 'Supercomputer' is actually a complex algorithm that uses a model based on betting market odds and the sports analytics company's own 'Power Rankings', which are calculated using past results.\nIt has simulated the 2025-26 competition 10,000 times and makes Liverpool favourites, with a 20.4% chance of winning, followed by Arsenal (16%), PSG (12.1%) and Manchester City and Barcelona (both 8.4%).\nDisagree with our expert humans or think you know more than any machine? You can make your own prediction and choose from all 36 teams at the bottom of this page.\nPhil McNulty: See my first answer, although I do think Arsenal and Manchester City have the capability to go deep into the competition as well as Liverpool. The Gunners reached the semi-final last season and have made serious moves this summer, so they will have high hopes.\nNicky Bandini: I've picked them to win it, so it has to be Liverpool! But many of the things I said about them could also be argued for Arsenal - a huge investment in an already top-class squad that wasn't so far off last time around. Really, all the English clubs ought to be capable of a deep run, given their resources. Premier League clubs spent more on transfers this summer than those from La Liga, Serie A, Ligue 1 and the Bundesliga combined.\nRory Smith: I'll go for Manchester City on the grounds that I think Arsenal will, come April, get distracted by their (eventually successful) pursuit of the Premier League title. I'd expect all six English teams will make the knockout rounds - and two or three to make the semi-finals - but Pep Guardiola will push particularly hard: Europe may well be his best chance of a major trophy.\nTheo Walcott: I think all six English teams will do well, not just Arsenal. I only maybe look at Newcastle and think they may not have the strength in depth for this competition, but they should still make the knockout stages.\nNedum Onuoha: Having six of them in there, who are capable of beating anyone, is going to be interesting. In terms of who will go furthest, I feel like Liverpool, City and Arsenal's chances are pretty similar. So, apologies to my City folk but I went back to last season and which team went the furthest.\nThat was Arsenal - and that semi-final defeat to PSG they felt so disappointed about. With the players they have brought in this summer, they are capable of going one step further and reaching the final this time.\nNo better team in competition than Arsenal - Arteta after Champions League exit against PSG\nSami Mokbel: Liverpool for all the reasons I've already mentioned. But, away from the Merseysiders, Arsenal look well-equipped to go deep into the competition. Their squad is among the strongest in European football.\nSteve Wilson: I like the look of Chelsea, but obviously Liverpool will strongly fancy their chances.\nStephen Warnock: Chelsea are my surprise package, but Liverpool will go the furthest of the Premier League sides.\nSteph Houghton: I see Liverpool as having the squad depth to be able to compete in all competitions. Their signings have added real quality to an already strong squad.\nMatt Upson: For similar reasons to why I think Barca will win it, I think Arsenal will do the best of the English teams. The core of their team is still together, they have strengthened their squad and they are also another big European campaign further along. They can use a run like the one they had last season in order to be even more successful.\nPat Nevin: I am certain Arsenal have got that depth you need to go far in this competition.\nChelsea have got a good chance of improving again but Arsenal, with their squad and especially when they get everyone back fit, will absolutely be able to manage.\nGuillem Balague: I think Chelsea are creating something special. Remember when their fans were moaning about the team?\nThe hardest thing is to see the bigger picture when you are a fan, but Chelsea have got youth, direction, a fantastic manager, ambition and order - in the same positional football PSG are so good at. Love their journey to the top.\nA 'new era' of the Champions League - all you need to know\nThomas Hitzlsperger: I've got two teams I'd like to mention here.\nThe first is Athletic Bilbao, who are a team I've been watching a lot and a unique club that I really admire. They are back in the Champions League for the first time since 2015 and their manager Ernesto Valverde has done a phenomenal job. They are a solid side, who have made a very good start to the new season.\nThe other team, Bodo/Glimt, have been one of my favourites for years and they have now finally qualified for the Champions League. People probably don't appreciate enough what they have achieved, even though they saw them reach the Europa League semi-finals when they played Tottenham last season. It's one of the best stories in modern football.\nJuventus and Manchester City both have to go to Norway to play them, in November and January, and they will definitely not be looking forward to those games.\n'Spurs are afraid and they should be' Bodo fans confident in the Arctic\nSteve Wilson: I'm not sure a club with their pedigree can be labelled a 'surprise package' exactly, but I have a real soft spot for Juventus, so I want them to do really well.\nNicky Bandini: Maybe Galatasaray. They have put together an astonishingly talented squad these last couple of years. I continue to think Victor Osimhen is one of the best number nines on the planet, so upgrading his loan into a permanent move was a coup, then on top of that they added Leroy Sane this summer, as well as Ilkay Gundogan and Wilfried Singo, who has had a solid couple of seasons at Monaco.\nYou could even throw Mauro Icardi into the mix as the cliched 'like a new signing' if he ever gets back to his best after the cruciate ligament injury he suffered last season. There's a lot for manager Okan Buruk to work with.\nJohn Murray: How about the Italian champions Napoli as the surprise package? Always difficult to beat in Naples, now with the added nous of Kevin de Bruyne to add to the wily ways of coach Antonio Conte.\nSteph Houghton: De Bruyne brings class, experience and something special to Napoli. Not many other players have what he has. He has a chance to win it with his new team.\nTheo Walcott: Bayern Munich will do well but I know I can't class them as a surprise package because they are expecting to win it. I'm going for Napoli, because of what De Bruyne brings to the table. Phil McNulty: The usual suspects will be involved, but any side coached by Conte will be well organised and a formidable opponent, so I will go with Napoli.\nAntonio Conte won Serie A for the fifth time as a manager last season - his first success with Napoli after lifting the title three times with Juventus and once with Inter\nSami Mokbel: Under Conte, Napoli have thrived. They won the Serie A title in his first season in charge and have three from three this season. And with De Bruyne in tow...\nRory Smith: There are no surprises in European football any more - the big clubs have spent the better part of 30 years killing them off. I think Qarabag will be better than many expect, based on their Europa League form last year, and Galatasaray and Athletic Bilbao might offer a bit of variety in the last 16. But in terms of actually progressing into the latter stages, it has to be Napoli, given the depth of squad Conte has built. Yep, that's right: this year's dark horses are... the champions of Italy.\nPat Nevin: They are a pot three team and they have never been to the Champions League semi-final, and I think they can get there... so that makes Napoli a surprise package even though I admit it's a bit of a cheat.\nMatt Upson: I suppose Napoli are a surprise on this stage - while they are flying in Serie A, if they did well in the Champions League it would probably come as more of shock than if Inter or Juve did, even though Napoli are probably the better team.\nNedum Onuoha: This is a bit of a paradox in some ways because they are in pot one, but I think Chelsea are very capable of beating absolutely anyone.\nThey are Club World Cup champions - I know some people want to disregard that title but most people thought that PSG side were unbeatable, so I'll give Chelsea some credit there.\nGuillem Balague: Watch out for Villarreal. They are solid, have signed players that will have to show their worth, but they have spent more than ever. Marcelino Garcia Toral is one of the top managers in Europe - have a look at his career - and offers physicality, order and quality upfront - the type of qualities that can take them far.\nWilliams scored the opening goal in the Euro 2024 final when Spain beat England 2-1 in Berlin\nRory Smith: The fact the younger Williams brother, Nico, is still at Athletic Bilbao is down, more than anything, to Barcelona's ongoing financial malaise, but it is the sort of thing that should be celebrated. He signed a 10-year deal this summer, and he will want to prove he can cut it on the biggest club stage. I'd mention Edon Zhegrova at Juventus, too, another edge-of-your-seat winger, but having two is cheating.\nGuillem Balague: Desire Doue (PSG), Lamine Yamal (Barcelona), Joao Pedro (Chelsea), Tajon Buchanan (Villarreal), Arda Guler and Kylian Mbappe (both Real Madrid)... do I have to chose just the one? This is a competition full of interest and quality. The toughest one to win.\nPat Nevin: Estevao Willian has got every chance of being one of the best in the business.\nNedum Onuoha: I wanted to go for Estevao but Pat Nevin took him first... so I have gone more defensive minded, and I've picked Dean Huijsen.\nIf Real Madrid are going to win the Champions League this year, it's going to come down to that big defender doing well for them, because a Xabi Alonso team is built on that strong defensive foundation, and I think Huijsen is going to be the star.\nTheo Walcott: I am really looking forward to seeing Arsenal's Eberechi Eze in the Champions League.\nIt's very different to Premier League football and there might be games where he gets a bit more time on the ball. When you give that time to a player like him, who is so gifted, it is exciting to think what he could do.\nIf I had to pick a player from outside the Premier League then it would have to be Yamal, because I don't see a lot of him. With Eze, I know what he can do and I want him to show everyone on this kind of stage.\nPhil McNulty: It's not a shock choice but I can't wait to see Yamal play for Barcelona, hopefully starting against Newcastle on Thursday, although the 18-year-old is struggling with a back injury picked up on international duty with Spain.\nPSG's Doue is another brilliant young talent currently struggling with an injury, but he is another who will light up the tournament when fit, as he did so wonderfully last season.\nMatt Upson: Yamal is the player I want to see. He is a ridiculous talent and I love watching him play.\nYamal's first goal for Barcelona in the first leg of their semi-final against Inter made him the youngest scorer in a Champions League semi-final - aged 17 years and 291 days - breaking Kylian Mbappe's record of 18 years and 140 days set in 2017\nJohn Murray: The player I'm looking forward to watching is Yamal as I am yet to commentate on him in a Barcelona shirt. While disappointingly it looks like he might not be fit for Thursday at St James' Park, I suspect there will be other opportunities as this Champions League progresses.\nSami Mokbel: At 18, Yamal is still a kid - but already one of the premier attacking talents in European football. Destined to be one of, if not the, best footballers in the world.\nSteph Houghton: Yamal is a global superstar. I'm excited to see how he performs against teams that are more than likely going to double up against him.\nNicky Bandini: We're all itching to see more of Yamal, aren't we? The two legs of Barcelona's semi-final against Inter last season will stay with me for a very long time. Maybe it's unfair to ask an 18-year-old what he can do for an encore, but you can't help but be excited at the prospect.\nThere are plenty of others I'm excited to watch too though! Of course we're all curious about Max Dowman after he made his debut for Arsenal at 15, and it'll be fun to see Scott McTominay in the Champions League with Napoli after he fired them to a domestic title last season and was named Serie A's Most Valuable Player. I wonder if this might be a breakout year for Kenan Yildiz too, still only 20 and with a full season of starting for Juventus now under his belt.\n'The Premier League was quite hard, I had to go off with cramps' - Woltemade\nSteve Wilson: Nick Woltemade was left out of Stuttgart's Champions League squad last season, so will presumably make his debut in the competition when Newcastle play Barca on matchday one. Memories of Tino Asprilla, anyone?\nThomas Hitzlsperger: It's probably not the most obvious choice, but I am going for Woltemade. There has been so much talk about him for a while - maybe not in England until Newcastle signed him for £69m, but definitely in Germany.\nBayern Munich wanted to sign him in the summer but Stuttgart would not sell him for the money they were offering. Bayern president Uli Hoeness says Woltemade is not worth what Newcastle paid for him, but the big price tag is not his fault.\nWoltemade has just helped Stuttgart win the German Cup and he has got something about him. He seems a very down-to-earth guy who you want to do well and I hope his ability will shine through in the Premier League as well as the Champions League.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone"

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5yg8rgyz3no?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
    "content": "Mykhailo Mudryk has not played for Chelsea in almost a year and was formally charged by the FA in June\nMykhailo Mudryk is currently suspended and unable to play for either Chelsea or Ukraine after being charged with a doping offence by the Football Association - but what is going on behind the scenes?\nThe 24-year-old winger was provisionally suspended in December 2024 after a urine test provided a positive result for a banned substance, and was formally charged in June.\nThe FA investigation is ongoing and the outcome, its timing, and any potential punishment all remain unclear. There is no defined time frame for doping cases - they last as long as it takes to sift through all the evidence.\nMudryk's legal defence is being managed by Morgan Sports Law, the firm who worked with former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba during his doping case while playing for Juventus, as well as boxer Tyson Fury and cyclist Chris Froome during their respective investigations.\nBBC Sport has taken an in-depth look at Mudryk's situation, talking to people in both Ukraine and London to find out where he is and what is going on.\nAfter news of his positive test was made public, Mudryk wrote on Instagram: \"This has come as a complete shock as I have never knowingly used any banned substances or broken any rules, and am working closely with my team to investigate how this could have happened. \"I know that I have not done anything wrong and remain hopeful that I will be back on the pitch soon.\"\nMudryk's legal team and those in his tight-knit circle insist he did not knowingly ingest any banned substance, and multiple sources claim he has passed an unverified lie detector test attesting to that.\nThe BBC has learned that Mudryk came into contact with the cardiovascular medication meldonium, which has the potential to increase respiratory capacity and stamina, while on duty with the Ukraine national team. When asked to verify this, the Ukrainian Football Association (UAF) did not issue a denial, but insisted none of their staff members were involved.\n\"UAF officials cannot comment on this matter, since the UAF is not a part of this case,\" it told BBC Sport. \"The World Anti-Doping Energy (Wada) or the English FA didn't send any request to the UAF.\n\"We are in close contact with Mudryk's lawyers and provide them with all necessary information. We cannot comment further, as a non-disclosure provision is in effect.\n\"No UAF official, staff, doctors, or coach were involved.\"\nUAF president and former Chelsea striker Andriy Shevchenko has not visited him at any point, although he also maintains a residence in London.\nIt remains unclear how exactly Mudryk apparently ingested meldonium, which has been banned by Wada since 2016 and is primarily used in Eastern European countries to treat conditions such as angina, heart failure, and coronary artery disease.\nTests at the 2015 European Games in Baku found that 13 medallists were taking the substance at the time, and that its use occurred in the majority of the sports included in the Games.\nWimbledon champion Maria Sharapova failed a drugs test in March 2016 after meldonium was detected in her sample.\nMudryk had been an important player for Ukraine prior to his suspension, having played 28 times since making his debut in 2022\nDuring the most recent international break, Ukraine's national team lost at home to France and drew away with Azerbaijan, meaning they risk missing out on qualification for the World Cup in 2026. Therefore, the absence of Mudryk has led to frustration and intrigue in the country.\nHis former club Shakhtar Donetsk stand to lose a potential €30m (£26m) in transfer add-ons, which were agreed by Chelsea when they paid an initial €70m (£61m) up front to purchase him in January 2023.\nThe conditions for those add-on fees to be paid are likely to never be fulfilled with Mudryk unable to play, but reports in Ukraine suggesting Shakhtar are considering suing the UAF over the potential lost earnings were described as \"nonsense\" by the club's CEO Sergei Palkin, and the club insists finances are not its primary concern.\n\"When we speak about Mudryk, we don't think about the money, we speak about the human being,\" the club's sporting director Dario Srna told BBC Sport. \"We feel so sorry for him. We know he is 100% innocent - he will show that. \"We support him like an ex-player, a human being and a friend. We don't think the money is important.\"\nMudryk became one of Europe's most highly rated young players during his time with Shakhtar\nShakhtar CEO Palkin added: \"From time to time, I've spoken with Mudryk on the phone, and we've even met a couple of times in London. We maintain contact because he is our academy graduate and a high-profile player. \"Our relationship has always been good, and I felt it was important to support him morally during this period.\n\"I honestly have no idea how this [positive test] could have happened. Based on the information available to me, I simply cannot understand the circumstances that led to it.\n\"I have been in contact with the UAF. I asked them to support Mudryk and requested that the lawyers handling this case respond responsibly and without delay.\n\"This situation affects the image of Ukraine and Ukrainian football as a whole. That's why, if there is any opportunity to help him, we must do so.\n\"I don't know where that information [about potentially suing the UAF] came from. It's nonsense. This idea has no basis whatsoever.\n\"I remain hopeful that this process with Mudryk will be resolved as quickly as possible, and that he will return to the pitch to continue his career.\"\nMudryk last made a public appearance after Chelsea's 4-1 Uefa Conference League final win over Real Betis, which he watched in a private capacity. The 24-year-old met supporters when out walking with friends in the Polish city of Wroclaw and attended Chelsea's celebration party at the team's hotel. Since then Mudryk has remained in London, though he is unable to play matches or even train alongside his team-mates. A devout Orthodox Christian, he frequently attends church and those around him insist he is in good physical and mental health.\nThe Ukrainian is training alone with a private coach at private facilities, and his camp is confident he is doing all he can from a fitness perspective to minimise any damage to his career. Chelsea are tracking his progress but the terms of his suspension mean he is extremely limited in the access he is allowed to the club, its facilities and his team-mates.\nMudryk last played for Chelsea on 28 November 2024 and was an unused substitute for a league match three days later against Aston Villa.\nThe club are expected to wait until the outcome of the case before commenting. If Mudryk is deemed to have broken the rules, he faces of a ban of up to four years.\nThe FA treats all doping cases confidentially - that means there is no information available about where there case is up to, or what the outcome might be.\nMudryk and his legal team could potentially mount an appeal - which would be assessed by the FA's anti-doping tribunal - if he is found guilty.\nThere is also the possibility of a further appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland after that.\nIn Pogba's case, 18 months passed between his initial positive test and the date he was permitted to return to playing football after his ban was reduced on appeal.\nSo whether or not he is found guilty, fans can still expect to wait a fair while before Mudryk takes to the field for any team.\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\nAsk about Chelsea - what do you want to know?"

    "content": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nProton VPN (2-Year)\nShop at Windscribe (Free)\nSurfshark (2-Year)\nThere are literally hundreds of VPNs floating around. They all want you to believe they're the best VPN you can buy. All of them say they have the biggest network, or claim they have a no-logging policy. And they all promise your internet traffic is safe on the network of servers they've rented. Only some of them are telling the truth.\nVPNs are only growing in popularity due to age-verification laws in the UK and in several states in the US. Even if you don't want a VPN, you might need one. If you're hesitant, I get it. VPN providers have been deep in murky waters for years, constantly caught lying about their practices, handing over user data that was never supposed to be logged, and serving as safe havens for large cybercriminal organizations.\nI wanted to find the VPN services that actually work; the ones that keep their promises even in the face of potential prosecution, and the ones that have a proven track record of reliable performance. Some of the picks in this guide aren't conventional, and some of the services I suggest you avoid might be controversial. But these are the top VPNs I'd use day-to-day.\nRead our other VPN guides, including how to set up a VPN on your router and how to use a VPN to watch Netflix when you travel abroad.\nHow Much Do VPNs Cost?\nThere's a broad range of prices for VPN services, but most providers sit somewhere around $10 per month for a monthly plan. That number changes if you purchase several months at once, and it's even more obfuscated with full security suites, such as those offered by Nord Security and Proton.\nMost of the prominent VPN services you'll come across offer multi-month, or even multi-year, discounts. These plans are often the best way to get your foot in the door, but recently, some VPNs have faced class-action lawsuits in regards to their auto-renewal practices. Although a handful of lawsuits have been filed, that doesn't mean these services necessarily engaged in illegal practices.\nFree VPNs exist, as well, but you should avoid most of them. Some restrictive free plans from Proton and Windscribe are useful, but you should handle most free VPNs with skepticism.\nWhat Does a VPN Do? And How Does It Work?\nVPN stands for virtual private network. A VPN provides a tunnel that all of your internet traffic passes through. Instead of connecting to the servers of your internet service provider, you connect to a server in the VPN's network before connecting to the broader internet. Due to how most VPNs services operate, your browsing data isn't stored, essentially making you anonymous online.\nThe linchpin in this system is a VPN protocol. Today, nearly all internet traffic is encrypted, but that encryption only happens once you've established a connection with a website. A VPN protocol encrypts traffic before it heads off to the VPN server, which adds some extra security on untrusted networks like public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop or airport. It doesn't help much on your personal network unless someone is intruding on it.\nAlthough VPNs are often marketed as security tools, they serve a better purpose for privacy and bypassing geo-restrictions. By anonymizing your traffic through a VPN server, your browsing can't be traced back to you. And, by routing your traffic through a server in another location, you can bypass geo-restrictions online, such as the content libraries available in different countries on Netflix.\nVPN Terms and Features, Explained\nYou'll come across a few of these terms in this guide and as you generally shop for a VPN. Here's what they mean.\nDouble-hop: Connecting to two (or more) VPN servers in succession. This provides an extra layer of privacy if someone traces your network path, but it will vastly reduce speeds.\nSplit tunneling: Allows you to choose which apps use the VPN tunnel. Useful if you want some apps (like your browser) to use the VPN tunnel but not others.\nKill switch: A security feature in VPNs that will disable your internet connection if the VPN connection drops. A kill switch can avoid leaking internet traffic in the event of a VPN failure.\nIP and domain block list: A list of IP addresses or domain names that are blocked inside the VPN tunnel. Some VPNs offer Domain Name System (DNS) blocking, too, which can block ads served from particular DNS servers.\nStatic IP: Most VPNs assign you a random IP address, or even rotate the IP address while you’re connected. If you need external access to your network with a network-wide VPN, you'll need a static IP address.\nPort forwarding: Allows you to forward a port on your private network, bypassing the VPN tunnel. Useful for instances where you need external network access with a network-wide VPN, such as running a media server.\nNetShield: A feature specific to Proton VPN that blocks ads and trackers while connected to the VPN. Other services, such as Windscribe and NordVPN, offer similar features.\nDark web monitoring: A feature available in some VPNs, such as NordVPN and ProtonVPN, that will monitor the dark web for your email address or other personal information. You'll be notified if the information shows up on the dark web, or as part of a breach.\nDAITA: A feature of Mullvad VPN that will introduce background noise to your connection, combating AI-assisted network analysis. Windscribe, NordVPN, and ProtonVPN have similar features available.\nAre VPNs Illegal?\nShort of a few exceptions, VPNs are legal around the world. That includes the US, UK, Canada, Australia, the EU, South Africa, and many countries in Central and South America. Countries such as North Korea and Turkmenistan have VPN bans in place, but due to the extreme censorship in those countries, it's hard to verify what laws are on the books (and how they're enforced). You can probably guess the North Korean government's stance on bypassing censorship, though.\nFor everyone else, the legality of VPNs only comes into play when it comes to what VPN you're using, and what you're using it for. Countries such as India and Russia call for compliance with the government, forcing providers like NordVPN to shut down servers in those regions. And, regardless of what country you're in, engaging in illegal activity while connected to a VPN is still illegal.\nProton\nProton VPN (2-Year)\nProton VPN (1-Year)\nProton VPN Plus is the best VPN you can buy. It's the fastest service I tested across the US and UK. It has a generous free plan if you'd like to try it out first. The features are unmatched, and the pricing is excellent, especially if you bundle Proton VPN with the company's other software (Proton Unlimited). After testing all of these services, Proton is what I personally use now.\nWhat sent Proton over the edge was its commitment to transparency. It has maintained a transparency report since 2017, undergone third-party audits annually since 2022, and open-sourced its applications five years ago. That last bit is huge, as bugs within the application can pose a security risk, and handing those applications over to the open source community can surface those bugs much faster. There are no real compromises here, with features like split tunneling, port forwarding, and double-hop connections.\nProton is a rare example of a VPN service that gets it. Every VPN engages in the same marketing practices, touting their security, speed, and privacy. But Proton puts its money where its mouth is, all while offering a remarkably easy-to-use and feature-rich VPN application.\nWindscribe\nShop at Windscribe (Free)\nWindscribe (Pro, One-Year)\nYou should generally avoid free VPNs, but Windscribe's VPN service is one of the few worth considering. You get 10 GB of data across 10 server locations and unlimited connections, and you can even unlock more data if you refer friends or post on social media about Windscribe. There are a few similar offers from services like Proton, but Windscribe provides a pleasant on-ramp for subscribing.\nYou can build your own plan. Unlimited data runs an extra $3 per month, and you can add server locations for an extra $1 per server per month. It's fantastic. Most people don't need VPN servers in Ghana, Cambodia, and Peru, so rather than charge for all those locations, you can pick out your locations piecemeal. If you want everything, that's available at a discounted rate too.\nThe pricing model is what sets Windscribe apart, but it's an excellent VPN in its own right. It offers additional packet obfuscation to combat network analysis, and it's loaded with features like split tunneling and port forwarding. It's fast, too, dropping just 15.6 percent of my speed when connected in the US. Like the other providers I've included, Windscribe has undergone a third-party audit. But unlike the other options, it's also been taken to court. Windscribe CEO Yegor Sak was personally charged with a crime in Greece in relation to a user's activity on Windscribe-operated servers, essentially tying activity on the network to Sak personally. It was dismissed. VPNs are subpoenaed all the time, but the fact that Windscribe wasn't able to produce logs even when the CEO of the company was facing criminal prosecution speaks volumes.\nSurfshark\nSurfshark (2-Year)\nSurfshark (1-Year)\nI've used Surfshark personally for a few years, and I'd still be using it if Proton didn't impress me so much. Surfshark is dead simple to use. It pops up and connects before swiftly getting out of my way so I can get on with my day. If you spring for a two-year plan, it's cheap. You can score over two years for around $50 with the Starter plan.\nIf you want to dig in deeper, you can. Surfshark is one of the most feature-rich VPNs I've used, sporting the basics like a double-hop connection and split tunneling, as well as an ad blocker and email masking. Like Proton, Surfshark offers other security tools like antivirus and dark web monitoring if you pick up a more expensive plan.\nSurfshark loses out just a bit when it comes to privacy, however. It has a no-logs policy, and it maintains a transparency report and a warrant canary, so there's no reason to suspect Surfshark is doing anything underhanded. But it doesn't have open source applications, nor does it offer anonymous payment methods. Those aren't big omissions for the vast majority of users, but if you need the utmost privacy, Proton or Mullvad (below) are better options.\nMullvad\nAny VPN worth its salt claims a no-logs policy, but almost all of them keep some logs. Those logs shouldn't have anything to do with your browsing data, and they should be anonymized, but most VPNs need to at least keep logs of information like your email and payment method. But not Mullvad.\nMullvad doesn't do multi-year subscriptions, referral links, or social sign-on. You generate an account number to sign up, and you add time to that account with the payment method of your choice, including a credit card, PayPal, crypto, or cold, hard cash (via mail). If you want to go through the hassle, you can stay fully anonymous in the eyes of Mullvad. If that wasn't enough, Mullvad even claims it was raided by Swedish police and still didn't produce logs.\nIt's not as fast as Proton, Windscribe, or Surfshark, but it's not bad, either—around a 24 percent drop in the US compared to 19 percent with Surfshark—and it lacks some features like port forwarding. But the pricing is good at roughly $6 a month, depending on exchange rates (Mullvad charges a flat €5 regardless of location).\nMullvad is on the bleeding edge of privacy, too, building RAM-only servers starting in 2022 and introducing defense against AI-guided traffic analysis (DAITA) last year. DAITA protects against AI traffic analysis, introducing network noise and sending consistent packet sizes to obfuscate your encrypted traffic further.\nNordVPN\nNordVPN (2-Year)\nNordVPN (1-Year)\nNordVPN has a long history, and it's one of the most prominent VPN services on the market. It comes with one of the largest VPN networks available, enough features to make Surfshark blush, and decent (though not the best) speeds. It's a little more expensive than I'd hoped for, but that's the price you pay for such an extensive network and feature set.\nWhere NordVPN really excels is in media. Streaming providers like Netflix and HBO Max are privy to how VPNs circumvent geo-restrictions, and a small network means you're more likely to get blocked. The fact that NordVPN has such a large network gives it an edge in streaming and less sensitive online browsing. It really wins with its NordWhisper protocol. The company recommends using its WireGuard-based NordLynx protocol most of the time, but NordWhisper sacrifices a bit of speed to obfuscate VPN traffic further, getting around most blocks.\nNordWhisper isn't made for normal streaming environments, but it's great to have on restrictive networks. If you're traveling internationally and using hotel Wi-Fi, for instance, NordWhisper can help circumvent VPN blocks. The company saw a minor breach in 2018 and stirred up controversy in 2022 with a subtle change in wording regarding cooperation with law enforcement. In both cases, it responded quickly and maintained transparency, so contrary to what you may have read, NordVPN is safe to use.\nPrivate Internet Access (PIA) has a long history in the VPN space, and it's maintained a track record of defending user privacy—even in the face of actual criminal activity. In 2016, a criminal complaint was filed in Florida against Preston Alexander McWaters for threats made online. McWaters was eventually convicted and sentenced to 42 months in prison. Investigators traced the online threats back to PIA's servers and subpoenaed the company. As the complaint reads, “A subpoena was sent to [Private Internet Access] and the only information they could provide is that the cluster of IP addresses being used was from the east coast of the United States.” McWaters engaged in several other identifying activities, according to the complaint, but PIA wasn't among them. Despite such a clear view of a VPN provider upholding its no-logging policy, PIA didn't impress me during my tests. It's slightly more expensive than a lot of our top picks, and it delivered the worst speeds out of any VPN I tested, with more than a 50 percent drop on the closest US server. (Windscribe, for context, only dropped 15.6 percent of my speed.)\nMysteriumVPN is the go-to dVPN, or decentralized VPN, as far as I can tell. The concept of a decentralized VPN has existed for a while, but it's really gained traction over the last couple of years. The idea is to have a network of residential IP addresses that make up the network, routing your traffic through normal IP addresses to get around the increasingly common block lists for VPN servers. Mysterium accomplishes this network with MystNodes. It's a crypto node. People buy the node to earn crypto, and they're put into the Mysterium network. It's not inherently bad, but routing your traffic through a single residential IP is a little worrisome. Even without the decentralized kick, Mysterium was slow, and it doesn't maintain any sort of privacy materials, be it a third-party audit, warranty canary, or transparency report.\nPrivadoVPN is one of the popular options to recommend as a free VPN. It offers a decent free service, with a handful of full-speed servers and 10 GB of data per month. You'll have to suffer through four—yes, four—redirects begging you to pay for a subscription before signing up, but the free plan works. The problem is how new PrivadoVPN is. There's no transparency report or audit available, and although the speeds are decent, they aren't as good as Proton, Windscribe, or Surfshark. PrivadoVPN isn't bad, but it's hard to recommend when Proton and Windscribe exist with free plans that are equally as good.\nFunctionally, a VPN should do two things: keep your internet speed reasonably fast, and actually protect your browsing data. That's where I focused my testing. Extra features, a comfy UI, and customization settings are great, but they don't matter if the core service is broken.\nSpeed testing requires spot-checking, as the time of day, the network you're connected to, and the specific VPN server you're using can all influence speeds. Because of that, I always set a baseline speed on my unprotected connection directly before recording results, and I ran the test three times across both US and UK servers. With those baseline drops, I spot-checked at different times of the day over the course of a week to see if the speed decrease was similar.\nSecurity is a bit more involved. For starters, I checked for DNS, WebRTC, and IP leaks every time I connected to a server using Browser Leaks. I also ran brief tests sniffing my connection with Wireshark to ensure all of the packets being sent were secured with the VPN protocol in use.\nOn the privacy front, the top-recommended services included on this list have been independently audited, and they all maintain some sort of transparency report. In most cases, there's a proper report, but in others, such as Windscribe, that transparency is exposed through legal proceedings.\n10% off Dell Coupon Code for New Customers\nSamsung Promo Code: 10% off TVs\nBusiness PCs - Extra 5% Off HP Coupon Code\n10% off Canon promo code with upgrade\nExclusive NordVPN Coupon: 76% off\nLG Promo Code: 20% Off Your First Order"

Learn more.\nEveryone has dirty ears; the human ear is designed to produce earwax to protect itself from other junk getting in there, among other things. That means that the more you put your precious new AirPods Pro in your ear holes, the dirtier they are likely to get.\nSo what's the best way to clean out all the gunk? Read below to learn how to clean your earbuds and over-ear headphones, as well as other ways to rehab an old pair.\nLooking for headphones? Be sure to check out our guides to the Best Wireless Headphones, the Best Wireless Earbuds, the Best Cheap Headphones, Best Workout Headphones, and the Best Gaming Headsets.\nBelieve it or not, the best thing I have found to clean earbuds (and phone jacks) is a soft-bristle brush like a toothbrush ($8 for six). Use this dry at first, and with a little bit of distilled and deionized water ($17 per gallon) or isopropyl alcohol ($10 for 32 oz) if anything is too stubborn to get out of the ear holes. Make sure to dry your earbuds with a microfiber cloth after.\nIf you have something large stuck in your buds, feel free to use a toothpick or loop tool to try to get it out. My favorite tools are these pop-out tools ($4) with metal nibs that let you snag tough wax and gunk.\nMost modern earbuds have an IP rating, which means they are relatively dust- and waterproof; you can typically run water over them and wipe them off with a towel to dry them if you have any gunk on the exterior of your buds. For over-ear headphones, I'd try to keep them as dry as possible when cleaning, but using a wet rag or brush to clean them shouldn't be a major issue, as long as you avoid areas like charging ports.\nMost brands, Apple included, offer replacement eartips and pads for their headphones, which can really make an older pair feel new again, especially if the foam is collapsed and dirty. I recommend changing pads as soon as you notice extra pressure or a lack of quality sound isolation. Eartips I just replace as they get deformed over time, or as I lose one.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

    "title": "The Best Ventless Fireplaces for Cozy Vibes (2025)",
    "url": "https://www.wired.com/gallery/the-best-ventless-fireplaces/",
    "content": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nThe primal urge to sit in front of a fire is in our DNA. That might be the reason I’ve typed “vintage electronic fireplaces” into Etsy’s search bar on more than one occasion. There’s evidence that fires can lower our blood pressure and induce relaxation as “part of a multisensory, absorptive, and social experience.”\nI’ve sought that elusive object of desire: an affordable freestanding ventless fireplace that can give my apartment the majestic warm glow that only a fireplace can deliver. For those of us who cannot retrofit our homes, change building codes, or persuade a landlord to build a chimney, the options for more than a simulacrum of the crackling fireplace are here.\nAnd going ventless isn’t just about cost; there are quantifiable health risks to living with an actual Yule log. It’s well established that wood-burning fireplaces negatively impact both indoor quality and outdoor air quality. A 2020 study published in Science of the Total Environment found that “long-term exposure to PAH levels measured in the fireplace room may contribute to the development of cancer.” PAHs are Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that occur during “the incomplete combustion of organic material”—think tobacco, coal, gasoline, and wood. PAHs are among “the 189 hazardous air pollutants covered under the Clean Air Act.”\nA 2023 study found that “increasing frequency of wood-burning indoor fireplace/stove usage was associated with incident lung cancer, even among never smokers.” Residential wood-burning fireplaces can increase levels of cancer-causing PAHs in local outdoor air pollution by orders of magnitude. Even though wood is renewable, it is not always eco-friendly.\nCould there be an affordable ventless fireplace that won’t increase cancer risk or speed up the earth’s demise? Possibly. There are two main types of freestanding, no-installation-required, ventless fireplaces on the market: The gel fuel kind that creates a real flame, and LED light models that produce a real flame moving image. I tested one of each, below, to give you an idea of what to expect.\nFor more warmth, check out our related guides, including Best Space Heaters, Best Smokeless Fire Pits, Best Down Comforters, and Best Heated Blankets.\nRealcozy\nAmazon\nRealcozy\nThe Realcozy Liberty Farmhouse Mantel LED fireplace is a heavy, made-to-order piece of furniture that required two white-glove professionals to move it into my apartment. They also did the assembly, including adding the optional fire glass rocks to create the ember bed, a decision I immediately regretted. When the fireplace isn’t on, the “glass rocks” look more like plastic ice cubes, and at some point I’m going to use my screwdriver to open the 42-inch fireplace insert and remove them.\nI loved the wooden design of the Liberty Farmhouse mantel. It is wall-mounted, flush, and looked like it has always been there. The 30-year-old company has multiple mantel designs, everything from corner versions to TV stand options, and in varying sizes and colors. They also come with a remote. The flames look real-ish. Unlike the Lloyd below, where you’re dealing with real fire, the Realcozy has stationary LED lights that shine onto a rotating reflector inside, casting realistic, flickering flame effects onto the screen.\nWith a click of the remote, I can cycle through different colors to illuminate the flame bed, including green and purple. I opted for the more natural reddish-orange.\nThe Realcozy has a heater, and at 5,000 BTU, the company claims it can heat a 500-square-foot living space. I’m not sure if that’s entirely possible, but it did warm up my 200-square-foot dining room during a late-spring cold snap when my apartment’s heat wasn’t turned on. In the evening, it gave my dining room a lovely fireplace vibe. Still, I felt like something was missing. I thought back to a review I had read and its suggestion of playing crackling fireplace sounds on a loop. I wanted sound. I was surprised to find more than a few fireplace crackling box options on Amazon. The need for fire sounds must also be in our DNA.\nI bought the Mseltos Fireplace Crackler Sound Box ($33) to add sound to my fake fireplace experience. The Crackler has a variety of fireplace sounds: hard, mild, weak, soft, super soft, or fiercely crackling, along with crackling with music. And reader, I needed those crackling sounds. While I wish the Realcozy came with sound, its looks, adjustable heater, and remote with built-in timer make the Realcozy my favorite ventless fireplace option. I also don’t have to worry about burns, explosions, or high levels of CO2.\nSolo Stove\nSolo Stove\nHome Depot\nThe Lloyd from Solo Stove pays serious homage to the freestanding mid-century enameled MCM Preway fireplaces that fetch thousands on the vintage marketplace. For less than $1,000 and a few minutes of assembly, the Lloyd may be a solution for those who want a real flicker. The Lloyd comes in five easy-to-love colors and most resembles the OG Malm Zircon. Made of electroplated steel, metal, and glass, the 31-pound Lloyd stands 3.5 feet tall.\nThe Lloyd uses TerraFlame gel fuel, a proprietary blend of isopropanol and ethanol that has a faint eau de Sterno, reminiscent of the times I’ve used my Le Creuset fondue pot. It burns smokeless and is virtually emission-free. The Lloyd does not come with an extended lighter, but it needs one. The first time I lit the Lloyd, I used a match and immediately regretted it. While the TerraFlame gel fuel cans are the same size as a scented candle, I underestimated the risks, as the flame was instant, large, and hot. I bought an extended curved lighter that worked perfectly.\nThere’s no denying the cool aesthetic of the Lloyd. It was a true novelty to have a real crackling flame in my apartment—it really brought the room together. I wish there were an option to buy a fake chimney extender to complete the illusion of a real fireplace. I sat on the carpet in front of the fire and planned to use the Lloyd for my next party or date night. There are few things that can instantly do the full ambiance makeover that a fireplace can achieve. My first time using the Lloyd, I didn’t let the gel fuel burn out. Snuffing the flame using the magnetic opener was a challenge. I needed oven mitts and metal tongs, and once I put the top on the canister, I couldn’t detach the magnetic snuffer and needed pressure with the tongs. This is where the glass shield proved an obstacle. It’s also too hot to move.\nIt’s worth noting that back in 2011, the US Consumer Safety Commission put out an executive summary about the risks of pourable gel fuel (not used in the Lloyd) for fire features and gel fuel, including the kind that comes in a can with a metal snuffer, similar to the type used in the Lloyd. There was also a recall of gel fuels back in 2011 due to burns and at least two fatalities. At issue was the consumer’s inability to assess risks because the flame seems like a candle and the actual flames are sometimes difficult to see. Most dangerous was the fact that refueling gel into a hot canister can cause an explosion. Explosions also occurred when consumers attempted to snuff out the flame on the cans. There are vapors and flames from the burning of ethanol. And while the summary is over a decade old, Lloyd’s user’s manual has a warning: “fire and explosive hazard, severe burns or death can occur, and never add fuel to a hot device.” And in regard to the TerraFlame, it comes with a Prop 65 warning: “Gel fuel when burning, may expose you to chemicals including carbon monoxide, which can lead to cancer and reproductive harm.” While I tested the Lloyd Modern Gel Fuel Fireplace, the above warnings apply to any fireplace that uses ethanol-based gel fuel.\nAnd there is no safe option for refueling. After reading the summary, including the dangers of snuffing the flame of a gel fuel can and the possibility of explosion, I’ve since let the fuel burn out all the way. When the Lloyd’s flame is out, that’s it—show’s over.\nA common refrain in the Solo Stove’s own reviews, and I found this to be true as well, is that the cans do not last the full three hours. In fact, one of the flames went out 45 minutes before the last one. A TerraFlame six-pack costs $40, making it a $5-an-hour fire experience. The Lloyd isn’t a practical heat source. While Solo boasts that the Lloyd brings 9,000 BTUs of heat, it is primarily for aesthetic purposes. I used the Lloyd in a 250-square-foot room and didn’t feel space-heater-like warmth. And, before you light your Lloyd, you’ll need to open a window.\nThere are significantly more cons with gel fuel fireplaces than there are with LED light models. For one, the gel fuel models can explode, killing or causing life-changing injury to the user. Biren Law Group posts regularly on TikTok about the dangers they’ve seen in home fires involving gel fuel. As for LED models, the biggest issue is sound. If you miss the crackle sounds that come with fireplaces, the LED models might be too fake for your liking.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

    "title": "Apple Watch Series 11 Review: Finally, the Watch Lives Longer",
    "url": "https://www.wired.com/review/apple-watch-series-11/",
    "content": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n9/10\nFor years, Apple has tried to extend the battery life of the Apple Watch. For as many years, the company has only succeeded by half measures. Features like Low Power mode or faster charging help you keep the watch on your wrist for longer, but Apple has not significantly improved the watch’s 18-hour battery life—even at last year’s much-hyped decade-versary of the Apple Watch.\nI say this to give the context of why such a little thing was so shocking. After wearing the new Apple Watch Series 11 for a full afternoon and wearing it to sleep, I woke up in the morning and discovered that I still had 58 percent battery left. 58 percent! I can wear the watch to sleep, get up, get my kids to school, and charge the watch when I’m at my desk! Constantly fussing over battery life was a major pain of the Apple Watch, and it’s been fixed.\nLonger battery life also makes it significantly easier to use Apple’s newest health features as well. If you have a Series 3 or 4 and have been waiting to upgrade, this is the year to do it. Too bad Apple couldn’t pull this off last year.\nFirst things first: The new Series 11 comes in 42- and 46-millimeter case sizes with aluminum and titanium finishes in a variety of colors—Gold, Natural, and Slate for titanium, Rose Gold, Silver, Space Gray, and Jet Black for aluminum). It has the same slim case as last year's Series 10, along with features like fast charging and a new, more scratch-resistant glass.\nApple CEO Tim Cook has long contended that the Apple Watch is meant to save your life. In accordance with this, the newest features on the watch (or more accurately, the watchOS 26 update that applies to all Apple Watches, Series 6 or later) are health-related. First, the watch now offers hypertension, or high blood pressure, notifications.\nUndiagnosed high blood pressure now affects as many as one in three people worldwide and can lead to heart attacks, stroke, or other long-term health conditions. The optical heart rate monitor on the watch purports to check how your blood vessels respond to your heartbeats; Apple says that the feature was developed with data from a series of studies that totaled over 100,000 participants.\nApple Watch Series 11\nRating: 9/10\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nTo get the notifications, you toggle them on in the Health app. Although the feature received FDA clearance as I was writing this review (and you can see the clinical validation here), the app explicitly warns you that this is not a medical device. You have to be over 22 and without a previous diagnosis of hypertension, and it should not be used to diagnose, monitor, or treat pregnancy conditions like eclampsia.\nBut if you’re mildly worried that you might have high blood pressure (which, apparently, we should all be), the app will ping you if it sees trouble signs so that you can double-check with your doctor and a separate blood pressure monitor (BPM). It requires 14 days of monitoring before you can get a hypertension notification, so I haven’t gotten one yet (and hopefully never will). If you get a notification, you can also log your BPM measurements in the app.\nThe Whoop MG was the first fitness tracker I tested that monitored high blood pressure, but you do have to calibrate it with a BPM before you can use it. It seems like this will quickly become a basic feature on many smartwatches. Apple’s other new health feature, Sleep Score, already is—it checks the duration of your sleep, your bedtime, and the number of interruptions to check if your sleep was restful or not. In my week’s worth of testing, Apple gives me almost perfect sleep scores, even on a night camping when our tent almost flooded, and another smart ring noted that my sleep was “agitated.”\nHowever, bedtime and duration are the only two factors we have real control over when tracking sleep, so maybe keeping the variables limited to what is actionable will prevent users from getting stressed. (You can also see your heart rate and respiratory rate in the Health app under the Sleep Score tab.)\nApple Watch Series 11\nRating: 9/10\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFinally, and this bears repeating, blood oxygen sensing is back on the watch and apparently for good. The prolonged legal battle over a feature that is by now standard on almost every other watch appears to be mostly over, so one of the biggest dings against the Apple Watch is gone.\nThe watch also has a few upgrades to make it easier to use without your phone. The cellular connectivity model has now been upgraded from LTE to 5G, plus there's satellite messaging, Find My via satellite, and Emergency SOS via satellite on the new Watch Ultra 3. To prevent reviewers from overrunning emergency services this weekend with false alarms (because we usually do call, just to check if it actually works), Apple conducted testing with reviewers on campus.\nI also went camping off-grid this weekend to test 5G and satellite messaging, and I’m happy to report that it worked! (I added the watch to my own cell plan to test for this review.) One feature that I like is that, unlike other, more rugged satellite messengers, the watch guides you toward satellites for better reception. Satellites do require a line of sight, so this feature might not work well under tree cover.\nIf you had cell coverage with your watch before, you might not notice the upgrade to 5G. I am not watching videos or playing Bloons on the watch, but my music did download slightly faster while running.\nSpeaking of running, Workout Buddy was one of the most hyped-up features in watchOS 26. (You must also have a phone that is capable of Apple Intelligence.) To toggle on Workout Buddy, go to the Fitness app on your phone, go to a specific workout, click the dialog box, and toggle on the specific voice that you want to give you your encouragement.\nApple Watch Series 11\nRating: 9/10\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nAs of publication, the AI-enabled personalized encouragement needs a bit more data to be useful. Right now, it cheerfully chirps my current stats with a disturbing amount of vocal fry, so I can’t really say that an AI workout buddy is preferable to a real-life one. I prefer walking, climbing, biking, or running with my real-life dog, friends, or kids as of now.\nAs for Liquid Glass, one of Apple’s most polarizing new features, you just don’t see it on the watch very much. Probably the most prominent places you can see it are in the new Flow face, which is just clear numerals with glowing blobs swirling around behind. I don’t object to how it looks, but as with last year’s Reflections face, I like to be able to see my notifications, steps, and battery life with my watch, so I don’t use it very much. The new Waypoint or even Exactograph is much more useful.\nThe wrist flick to dismiss the Smart Stack is nice; if you've gotten used to using Double Tap or shaking your head to dismiss Siri with your AirPods, you will find this familiar.\nI generally say that if the latest watchOS is available on your watch, you probably don't need to upgrade. WatchOS 26 is available on all watches Series 6 or later; however, this is the first year I'd say that it’s worth getting a new watch, especially if you’ve been waiting to buy one for a kid or elderly relative.\nI had the opportunity to test the new Apple Watch SE ($249) and Apple Watch Ultra 3 ($799) as part of this review. The Watch SE hasn't been updated since 2022, and that second-gen model just didn't have many of the latest health features that are by now standard on every fitness tracker. The new Watch SE 3 has the latest chip and many of the health features that the older Watch SE did not have, like wrist temperature sensing and sleep apnea detection. Although it does not have the full 24 hours of battery life the Series 11 boasts, I still managed to eke out a day on one charge somehow. And it still costs only $249.\nApple Watch Series 11\nRating: 9/10\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nThe new Watch Ultra 3 claims a full 42 hours on full power, up from 36 hours on the Watch Ultra 2. That means you can wear it for a weekend of navigation, satellite messaging, and activity tracking, which you definitely could not before. I tested this out this weekend on a camping trip with trail running, navigating for a several-hour-long drive, and satellite messaging, and it lasted from Friday morning to Sunday morning. It really is a weekend watch now, fulfilling the promise the original Watch Ultra made several years ago.\n24-hour battery life is huge. Many users, including my own spouse, did not wear the Apple Watch to sleep, just because it was too annoying to wake up with a drained watch. Being able to wear the watch for 24 hours, instead of skipping one-third of each day, is a sea change.\nEven if I find 5G to be personally negligible, satellite messaging dramatically adds to the usefulness of the watch. There are many times that I walk off without my iPhone, especially while camping, hiking, or running. The standard use case I give is leaving a campsite to pee—you think you've walked just a few yards to get behind a tree, and when you look up, you're totally disoriented. Even without the watchOS 26 updates, these two features alone are worth upgrading for. It's a good year for the Apple Watch—dare I say, the year that last year should've been.\nApple Watch Series 11\nRating: 9/10\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

    "title": "Human Design Is Blowing Up. Following It Might Make You Leave Your Spouse",
    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/human-design-is-blowing-up-following-it-might-make-you-leave-your-spouse/",
    "content": "Travis Day regrets being so strict with his ex-partner about never sleeping in the same bed.\nAccording to human design, the New Age “synthesis” of astrology, the I Ching book of Chinese wisdom, Kabbalah, and the chakra system, “everyone should sleep in their own bed at night” to preserve their auras, says the blond 38-year-old Los Angeles County-based surfer, who’s been following the practice rigidly for the last five years.\n“She was not happy and really hated having to go back to her place,” says Day, now a human design coach with 11,000 followers on Instagram. He didn’t know how much the “auric distancing” bothered her, he says, “until she finally expressed it when we were breaking up.”\nHuman design dictates that people inevitably fall into five archetypal personality categories: manifestors, generators, manifesting generators, reflectors, and projectors. The mystical, mechanical inner-discovery system turned Day’s life around when he spontaneously received a reading on a beach just outside of LA in August 2020. He was at a financial and emotional “rock bottom” amid the failure of his “beachproof” dog accessory brand, but that initial personality analysis represented “the first time someone actually saw me.”\nDay was told that he was projector, and that he shouldn’t hustle hard but instead follow the intuition of his spleen, the little-understood organ in the upper abdomen which is traditionally believed to be the seat of bad temper.\n“For a long time I had depression and talked terribly to myself,” the California native tells me over a Zoom call. “But human design showed me that I actually hated not being me.”\nHuman design, a philosophy that spans self-improvement to more extreme beliefs like life being predetermined, alien influence on earth, and a coming planetary shift, is approaching a high watermark cultural moment. It might not be long before the phrase, “that’s so mani-gen” is as common, in certain circles, as “that’s so Leo.” Some human design coaches have more than 100,000 followers on social media, offering people advice on everything from love lives to how to get rich.\nThere are coaching programs and entire centers dedicated to learning and teaching the practice as retreats are cropping up in wellness hotspots from Puerto Escondido, Mexico, to Sofia, Bulgaria. Readings can cost hundreds of dollars; TikTok creator Kendra Hilty, who went viral after documenting how she fell in love with her psychiatrist, received $3,000 for three months of weekly human design readings, according to The Cut. Even as I’m writing this article, I pass a bookstore in Vancouver, Canada with a human design book prominently displayed in its front window.\nThe buzz around this radical system has led people to take life-changing decisions like ending their marriages or moving countries after single readings, which can also be conducted with ChatGPT. “You may realize you don’t love your partner, you hate your job, you can’t stand where you live, and you’re dying inside,” Day says. But he tells WIRED there are culty elements in the ecosystem of training connected to this “new astrology.”\nIn the new season of Love is Blind: UK, contestant Patrick Justus, a human design coach and “splenic projector,” like Day, propels the phrase “trust your spleen” into the zeitgeist; the show has used the slogan in its marketing ads next to Justus wearing an eye mask. “Listening to my spleen is the best way for me to find the love of my life,” he tells one of his first dates on the show.\nAfter several promising dates with singer Aanu Adewole, Justus starts to doubt the message from his spleen, noting it is “silent.” He dumps Adewole after she appears reluctant to sing for him and confesses that if her mother vetoed him she would drop him. “I have to follow my spleen,” Justus told her. “It breaks my heart to tell you I’m breaking up with you.” (It later emerged that another woman may have been pregnant with Justus’ child during the filming of the series and that he had omitted to mention it. In a statement Justus provided to the show for its reunion episode, he said: “2025 has been life-changing as I embrace the joy of becoming a father.”)\nJustus’ seemingly strict adherence to his human design is not an anomaly. One coach tells WIRED she decided to divorce her husband after doing a reading on a flight to Hawaii, where they were due to start a new life together. To follow the teachings attached to one’s human design is to “decondition” from the societal influences that have molded people to be not their true selves. But Redditors report being scared to “decondition” and make the drastic lifestyle changes required to bring them into greater accordance with their design.\nOthers claim to have gone to extremes in attempts to live fully in accordance with the teachings and what Day describes as “not self-conditioning forces.” These supposedly show up when one is out of alignment with their design and can include frustration, anger, bitterness, or disappointment. The drastic measures some have taken to “self-harmonize” have included moving alone to remote areas. In an Instagram reel, one human design advocate promotes the consumption of “single-ingredient foods” such as polenta to live within their design.\nErin Claire Jones, a human design coach with 172,000 followers on Instagram, says the detail in human design assessments is also part of its appeal.\n“I've seen the most skeptical people fall in love with it because it's practical, but it's also so specific,” she says, noting the rise of human design from the extreme fringes towards the mainstream in recent years reflects an increasing collective desire to “learn about ourselves,” warts and all.\nOver the past decade Jones has sold 43,000 personalized design guides mostly for $95 each, conducted sessions with 4,000 people, and trained another 1,500 in how to give readings, en route to publishing the book How Do You Choose? with publisher HarperCollins this year. “Human design is far more mechanical [than astrology] in terms of, ‘Hey, this is how you make decisions.’” Sometimes she observes people and guesses their designs at parties, but she admits to not always getting them right.\nJones, who has blonde highlights and well-defined cheekbones, says she has worked with a host of startups and CEOs of small companies to help improve teamwork and boost productivity. She helps people use human design within their own families to help foster more harmonious relations, and also does so herself. “My daughters both have entirely different designs than mine, my husband does too,” she says, explaining that, like many over coaches, she is a projector. “It's been so useful to be like, ‘I'm not expecting either of my daughters to be anything like me’.”\nHuman design was born in 1987 when Canadian former advertising executive Robert Krakower, a rumored ketamine enthusiast who had been living like a hippie and residing in a dilapidated casita in Ibiza, claimed to have had an intense transcendental encounter with “the voice” over the course of eight days. As origin myths go, his makes Moses at the burning bush sound almost low-key.\nKrakower, a bearded Mufti headdress-wearer who worked part-time at a local school, was walking with his dog when it picked up a scent and approached an abandoned house, noticing a light beneath the door. He shouted at the door and demanded to know, “Who’s there?,” he recalled once in a lecture in Germany. Once inside, the heavy smoker said he heard a voice he imagined to come from “a cigar-smoking 155-year-old woman.”\nThen Krakower claimed he started gushing with sweat from head to toe. He went back to his nearby home and said “the voice” instructed him to place his Bible, Bhagavad Gita, and Stanford biology textbook together, along with a chessboard and a copper coil. He said he was told to burn a combination of herbs from the shelves and that a series of cosmic revelations ensued, spanning the Big Bang, the nature of being, the “crystals of consciousness,” and “rave cosmology,” a far-out prophecy he went on to make, predicting alien influence in a prophesied influx of disabled and mute children born in or after 2027.\nAll of this information would help Krakower—who soon renamed himself Ra Uru Hu, a play on his name Robert, a word from “the voice,” and the moment when he demanded to know who was behind the door—forge the pseudoscientific human design system and the bodygraphs which help uniquely define each person according to a series of numbers in his 1992 guide, The Black Book. “Madness is an interesting thing,” said Krakower, who was a “splenic manifestor” and died in 2011 of a heart attack at age 62. “I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. Like, caught in this incredible, choiceless movie.”\nIn accordance with Krakower’s prophecy, Richard Beaumont, the director of Human Design UK, who worked closely with Krakower for years before his death, has already purchased the domain name silentbabies.com. “There's going to be a new species coming in February 2027,” he says, sipping a glass of white wine in front of a human design chart over Zoom from his home in the west of England.\n“They're not going to be human, but they will come through human women.” (The human design school Krakower founded, the Jovian Archive, sells an online course centered on the alien prophecy for $2,079, and the organization warns of “imitators and unlicensed black marketeers” across the global network of licenses, trademarks and authorized teachers.) Human design is not a belief system, says Beaumont, who has 38,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel. “This is an endless knowledge … We're not here to interfere with who we are; we're here to decondition.”\nDay —who recently founded a “projector only” online community dedicated to “deconditioning” and other activities like singles nights—claims that some leading figures in the movement can be incredibly prescriptive. Last year, he won a raffle to attend a retreat hosted by certain high-profile teachers. There, he says, the cultic, controlling tendencies of parts of the community were laid bare.\n“I had never seen so many unhappy, angry people,” he recalls. “People get really attached to making it into rules and then saying, ‘This is what you can do, and this is what you can't do based on your design.’” He saw people telling others such things as: “‘You're out of alignment’, ‘You have an open throat chakra, and you're not supposed to do this’.” It's a “fucking Wild West,” Day says of the sprawling human design industry. “If you want to manipulate someone … The easiest thing to do is sell them on inspiration.”\nAt the same time, he admits that giving human design readings for $250 each has turned his fortunes around; he does at least three readings per week, in addition to offering other services.\nPerhaps my fortunes will change, too, if I live more in accordance with whatever my design is, following a recent split which left me soul-searching.\nI give Day my time and date of birth and the name of the city I was born, just like with a Zodiac reading, and he inputs the information into a website that conjures a diamond-shaped “bodygraph” which, he says, reveals a distinct numeric genetic code underpinning my “manifesting generator” personality. “Your mind will say you always need to be looking for love and direction, [but] you’re super sensitive to others’ frequencies,” fellow singleton Day tells me. Therefore, it is extremely important that I sleep in my own bed each night to preserve my aura.\nBut I do hope to find love again, so maybe I'll allow a sleepover once in a while."

    "title": "Matthew Prince Wants AI Companies to Pay for Their Sins",
    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-podcast-matthew-prince-cloudflare/",
    "content": "Matthew Prince may not be a household name, but the world most certainly knows his work.\nPrince is the cofounder and CEO of Cloudflare. Launched in 2010, the internet infrastructure company has found itself increasingly in the position of serving as the web’s bodyguard. It filters out bad traffic, keeps sites safe, and stops them from crashing when too many people visit. Its tools defend against DDoS attacks. In 2017, Cloudflare made headlines when it dropped white supremacist site The Daily Stormer. (Maybe Prince’s name is ringing a bell now?)\nCloudflare’s severing of ties with The Daily Stormer marked a momentous shift, one that came after years of claiming a neutral stance. Prince continues to evolve the way Cloudflare works. In July, the company rolled out a new tool tasked with blocking unauthorized AI scraping. It effectively creates a pay-per-crawl model requiring AI platforms to shell out money if they want access to a site’s content.\nOn this episode of The Big Interview, I talked to Prince about publishing, the old internet, and how his ideal version of the future web means that OpenAI just might become the Netflix of content.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nKATIE DRUMMOND: Good to have you here, Matthew.\nMATTHEW PRINCE: Thanks for having me.\nYou should have been warned ahead of time, but you probably weren't. We always start these conversations with some rapid-fire questions. Think of it like a warmup.\nSort of like wind sprints or something.\nExactly. First, what's the most embarrassing thing that regularly shows up in your feeds?\nProbably just all the political content. On X it’s pretty embarrassing.\nWhat can you teach me to do in two minutes or less? You don't actually have to teach me anything, but you need to commit that you could do it if you had to.\nI am pretty good at simple card tricks, so I could teach you a card trick to impress your friends.\nOh, I like that. I like impressing people. Fiction or nonfiction?\nI tend to read more nonfiction, but I'm happier when I'm reading fiction. So I try to force myself to read fiction. The trashier the better.\nAlright, trashy fiction. What do your haters say about you?\nOh God, people talk about neo-Nazis surprisingly a lot with me because we either kick or don't kick them off our platform. So I think [they say] I am responsible for all the bad things that appear somewhere on the internet.\nInbox zero or inbox chaos?\nZero.\nSame. OK, let’s jump into it. Are you ready?\nI am. Those were fun wind sprints. I enjoy that a lot more than, you know, high school PE.\nWe do our best. Now, I love to ask people a little bit about where they came from, how they got to where they are. So I’m going to do that before we really get into what’s going on with Cloudflare right now.\nThe original name of Cloudflare was the only thing worse than Cloudflare, because [those syllables] are really hard for English speakers to say. We were going to be Project Web Wall.\nLet's go back to where it started. Park City, Utah, where you grew up. You got your first computer. My understanding is you were 7. Were you always drawn to technology, even as a toddler, or was that sort of a lucky accident as far as gifts go?\nI got it from my grandmother, who was just with it. Apple had just released the Apple II. There wasn't a ton of access to technology in the way that kids have it today. So everyone else had an Atari. Everyone else had a VHS player. We had a Betamax player. But the computer was really the first time that I dove in and it was like a duck to water. I loved it.\nYou majored in English, and you minored in computer science. Then you went to law school. What did you think you would end up doing?\nI thought I was gonna be the in-house counsel for some cool tech company.\nOh, I like that.\nI was good at computers as a kid, and the University of Utah had this incredible computer science program, and they did these continuing education courses and my mom would sign up. And then I’d do all the homework, basically. So by the time I got to college, I thought I was gonna study computer science. I took computer science 101 and I was so bored that an arrogant 17-, 18-year-old me was like, “There's nothing I can learn from this.”\nSo I switched my major to English literature. This is like ’92 to ’96. This was right as the internet was taking off. And I knew enough about it that I got hired to be one of the student network administrators on our campus and help build what was one of the first thousand websites. I felt like I was sort of there, but I was also kind of burned out from the whole thing.\nI wrote my college thesis on why the internet was a fad.\nNo.\nYeah. It was pretty embarrassing. I predicted that search engines were gonna become political, that there would be a conservative one and a liberal one. That hasn’t happened.\nThat's interesting considering what’s happened with Cloudflare.\nWhen I got to the end, I was pretty good at standardized tests, so I took the LSAT. Didn't know how to really get a job, so I ended up applying to law school, and I went to law school and in ’96 being like, “Eh, this internet thing is a fad.”\nSomewhere in between I took a year off to basically goof around and be a ski instructor. By the time I actually got to the first day of class, I realized two things: One, the internet was gonna be kind of a big deal. And the second thing was that within about three days of law school I was like, “I'm not sure I'm cut out for this.”\nOh.\nI finally found a type of law that I thought was really interesting, which was securities law, basically taking companies public. I spent the summer of ’99 working at a law firm in San Francisco. I worked on six IPOs in one summer. It was the dotcom boom. I was like, “This is really fun.”\nI bet.\nI thought, “I’ll go, I’ll do this for five years. I’ll find a company that’s really great, I’ll help them get ready for their IPO, they’ll hire me as their counsel.” I went back to school thinking that was what was going to happen in March of 2000. Then the bubble burst. The law firm called and said, “Hey, good news, bad news. The good news is you still have a job. Bad news is we don’t need any more securities lawyers, but bankruptcy is basically the same thing …”\nOh no.\nI just didn't want to do that. So I was crying in my beer with a young law-professor guy named Doug Liman, and he's like, “Hey, my brother's starting a B2B”—what we call a SaaS company today, although we didn't at the time, in the insurance industry, which I knew nothing about—“would you be interested? They'll match your salary and give you this thing called stock.” I was like, “Yeah, that sounds better than being a bankruptcy attorney.” So I did that, and it was a disaster.\nThat is a journey. There's been a lot written about Cloudflare's origins. But just so that people have a basic understanding, how would you describe the company's original mission, and how has that evolved?\nI was super lost. I was working as a bartender. And somewhat to run away from the sort of familial obligation of taking over my father's restaurant business, I applied to business school, and that's where I met my cofounder Michelle. What we saw back in 2009 was that all of the world of software was moving to the cloud. So inevitably that would mean that the security and networking tools, the firewalls of the world, would move to the cloud. So the original idea of Cloudflare was: How can you take a firewall and put it in the cloud?\nMakes sense.\nThe problem that we had was we knew that in order to be a successful business, we'd eventually have to sell to really big banks and health care companies and governments and things like that.\nRight.\nIn order to do that, we had to have something that was valuable in order to generate something that's valuable. We actually had to have data. So being plucky business students, we thought, “Well, what if we made a sort of stripped-down, light version of the service and gave it away for free?”\nThat would allow us to gather a bunch of data that would be valuable for the firewall, for the big banks and things like that. At some level the whole story of Cloudflare is: If you take a firewall in the cloud and make it free, you create so many different problems. But in the process of solving all of those problems you build what Cloudflare is today, which is more than just a firewall in the cloud.\nTell me how you describe the company today, and then I wanna jump into why you've been in the news so much recently.\nIf I'm at a dinner party and you come up and ask me, “What do you do?” And I say, “I work for Cloudflare.” And they ask, “What does Cloudflare do?” I don't really want to talk to you much more. I say, “It makes the internet faster and protects it from bad guys,” and everyone's response to that is, “Oh, that's really nice.” And then they walk.\nThey're like, “Oh, sounds great.”\nYeah, “Thank you for doing that.” If I want to actually engage with someone, what I would say is, “When we wrote all the protocols for the internet in the ’60s, ’70s, and ’80s, we had no idea what the internet was gonna become.”\nIf you go back and read the original proposal for DNS or BGP or these fundamental kinds of technologies of the internet, like there's a section often on security, and it says, “This section is intentionally left blank.” Right? So no one has actually done the work to do that. And that's true in security. It's true in reliability, it's true in performance. And so now that we know how important this is, how do we go back and redesign all of those fundamental things about the internet?\nThat's what motivates everyone at Cloudflare; that's what defines our roadmap. When we say we're trying to help build a better internet, that's literally what we try to do every single day.\nSo let's talk about that better internet in the context of AI. A few months ago your company made major news, especially with people working in media or the creator class, around what you are doing with AI bots and their ability to scrape websites with impunity.\nThat’s how a lot of these AI models were trained in the first place, right? They scrape the internet, pull whatever content they want, and use it to train LLMs. Your company has now taken a major stand to stop that from happening without financial incentives for the creators of that content. Tell us a little bit about where that idea came from.\nSo, my cofounder Michelle hates history lessons. I, on the other hand, am a recovering adjunct law professor. So …\nOh boy.\nLet's just talk about the history of the internet, where we've been, where we are, where we're going, and what the opportunities and what the challenges are. So, the first thing is that there's this sort of mistaken belief that the web has been free. The web has never been free. Somebody has always paid for the web, because journalists like yourself and other folks at Condé Nast, other folks at, you know, all of the different media companies, they deserve to eat.\nAgreed.\nYou know, if you go to a restaurant, they kind of want you to pay your bill. So somehow there has to be money that goes back to the people that are creating stuff, whether it's news or entertainment or anything else.\nFor the last 25 years, the great patron of the internet has been Google. They created this incredible tool to let you search for things and then it gives you a treasure map and you can click on the links in that treasure map, and that will take you to content that Condé Nast or Meredith or whoever it is [created]. The key was that the traffic that their treasure maps generated then provided tools to turn that traffic into revenue, into dollars, that you could then pay creators with.\nYes.\nLike, that’s an amazing thing. It has, at the same time, had some perverse effects [since] traffic has never been the best measure of quality in any kind of objective sense. You also had a bunch of publications like BuzzFeed that would literally A-B test headlines to figure out which ones generated the largest cortisol response, the largest stress response, because baiting you into clicking things—regardless of what the quality of the actual content was—was kind of the game.\nIt became all about SEO.\nAgain, I think Google has been a massive force for good in the world. The internet would not exist in the form that it is right now without Google's patronage. But that same sort of traffic-is-all-we-care-about [idea] is what led to Facebook, which was what led to TikTok. And we've kind of spiraled down this sort of attention-economy hole where I think all of us feel a little bit wistful for the internet of old, right? So that's kinda where we are today in terms of the content side.\nRight.\nWhat's been happening, though, is that the entire industry has moved away from search being the dominant interface of the web. You can actually see this at Google itself. Now, if you run a search it gives you back an answer at the top of the page. It doesn't give you a treasure map. Instead it provides you what they call an AI Overview, which has taken a whole bunch of content, smashed it together, summarized it in various ways, and synthesized it.\nAnd Google is just one piece. Like if you look at Perplexity, if you look at OpenAI, if you look at Anthropic, they're not search engines, they're answer engines.\nThe difference is that if you just give someone the answer, then they don't generate traffic. They don't follow those links. We have the data on how much of that has changed. The short answer is that in Google's case it's about 10 times harder today, because of AI Overviews, to get traffic for the same amount of content than it was back when Google was just 10 blue links.\nAnd I would say [Google] has been very resistant to the notion that AI Overviews have damaged traffic to publishers.\nI think they've been very careful in saying that they're still sending a bunch of clicks to the web, but they've been very imprecise about what parts of the web are benefiting, what parts are hurting.\nSo what we see is that if you're an ecommerce shop, AI Overviews haven't hurt you as much because, again, people still have to buy the thing. So they're like, “OK, which digital camera is the best digital camera to buy?” And they get an AI Overview that answers that, but they still then have to go buy the digital camera. So they still go to one of the digital camera sellers that's out there, but they're not reading WIRED's description of what digital camera is the best directly.\nRight.\nI think they very much know that for things that are just purely information-based, the traffic to those things is just falling off of a cliff. But again, they couldn't generate that AI Overview if they hadn't slurped up the data from WIRED, and Ars Technica, and all the different companies out there that are actually doing the work to review the cameras.\nI’m still waiting for my check from Google. When is that coming?\nGoogle does send you a check, but they only send you a check—not personally, maybe—if a human has followed a link and then there's an ad that DoubleClick serves. So Google is still supporting the ecosystem, but that support is declining, declining, declining.\nAs we shift from search engines to answer engines, the future is going to look different than the past, and I think that there are three possible outcomes. The most nihilistic of all is you starve to death and die.\nI personally, and other journalists, don’t want that.\nAnd not just journalists. Academics, researchers, that whole group. It is terrifying to me how many people out there, sort of the AI maximalist camp, are like, “Why do we need journalists anymore? We have drones.” And I'm like, “You really have no earthly idea what good journalism is.”\nSure, the facts, you can do that. But the real color of someone saying, “Hey, your house just was swept away in the flood. How are you dealing with that?” That really is an incredibly important thing.\nThe reporting, the storytelling, the investigative work. It is human-led work.\nSo the nihilistic version is awful and I think unlikely to happen. The second possibility, which I think is frighteningly likely to happen, is what I would call the Black Mirror possibility, which is that journalists and academics and researchers don't go away, but we don't go back to the media of the 1980s. We go back to the media of the 1400s, where every journalist, every researcher, every academic is employed by one of five big families.\nBut it's not families anymore. It's AI companies. And it's not too crazy to imagine a world where Sam Altman says, “You know what? We're just gonna stand up our own Associated Press.” Right? “Lots of unemployed journalists out there. We're gonna hire them; we're gonna stand up bureaus all around the world.”\nIf they do that, then Anthropic has to do it, and everyone else has to do it. Then they’re feeding the machine that’s out there. If that happens, we get back to my college thesis, which [means] there will be a conservative one, and there will be a liberal one, and there’ll be a Chinese one, and there’ll be an Indian one. Europeans will try to create one and eventually just use the liberal US one.\nThat’s not crazy, but think about how backwards-moving that is. The internet has been this great information equalizer, democratizer. And in this world, all of a sudden, you subscribe to one of the five big AI companies and you get their perspective. It’s going to be very difficult if it’s thousands of dollars a month for your AI subscription. You’re not going to subscribe to two, very few people will. So information in that world gets incredibly siloed, but it’s not crazy.\nOK. What’s the third possibility?\nRight now everyone’s getting content for free. In the future, I think the AI companies will look less like science labs and look more like Netflix, where what differentiates them is whether or not they have access to unique content, and that unique content is something they will be willing to pay for. That’s the day in which not only Google but OpenAI and Perplexity and Anthropic and all the different AI companies—hopefully there are thousands of them—are sending you a check.\nWell, I’m waiting. But Cloudflare is doing something very fundamental in helping ensure that third possibility becomes a reality. Tell us a little bit about how that works.\nOK, so that third possibility is a market. The one thing that every market has in common is scarcity. You can't have a market if there's no scarcity. Like there’s no market for breathable air because in most places there’s plenty of breathable air.\nYeah, for now.\nWe’ve talked about a lot of dystopian futures, and we can talk about more if you want, but let’s just try to figure out …\n… let’s stick to this one.\nSo the problem that we saw was that our customers who were publishers, and the entire publishing industry, wasn’t creating scarcity. A lot of that was that they didn't have the technical wherewithal to actually identify who the AI scrapers were and block them from taking their content.\nWe're really good at that. Like that's what we do every day. We built these tools to stop Chinese hackers or Iranian hackers or Russian hackers. But those same tools also identify “that’s the Perplexity bot” or “that’s the ByteDance bot.” We can give publishers the tools to do that.\nIf our mission is to help build a better internet, it makes total sense for us to not only build those tools, but then make them available for free to anyone who is creating content online and wants to say, “I don't want you to have my content unless there's some exchange of value.”\nThere’s always been an exchange of value in the search engine world. The exchange of value was that the search engine got your content and in exchange they sent you traffic and then helped you monetize that traffic. As the world moves toward answer engines, we have to figure out what that new exchange of value is, but step one is creating scarcity.\nHave companies taken you up on that offer? What’s the response been like?\nOn the content creator, publisher side it has been extraordinary. Everyone from the Associated Press to Ziff Davis and every publisher in between has come to us and said, “We've been waiting for someone to come along.” The most common thing I’ve heard as I’ve talked to the CEOs of publishing houses is, “I’ve gone from being just depressed, like there’s nothing I can do, to actually being optimistic.”\nI mean, I cannot overstate what a significant step this is.\nThe music industry on some level is an analogy. The day before Steve Jobs steps on stage and announces iTunes, 99 cents per song, the entire music industry is worth $8 billion. Not revenue, market cap. That’s a big number, but for the influence that it had in that world, it was actually relatively modest. Ninety-nine cents a song isn’t the business model that ended up winning. It ended up being something closer to Spotify, and there’s still record sales. There’s Spotify and Apple Music and Tidal and YouTube and TikTok. They’re all sending dollars to music creators. Spotify sent $10 billion. So they sent more in cash to music creators and that ecosystem in the last year than the entire industry was worth 18 years ago.\nYou've gotten a lot of really positive press for this. What's in it for Cloudflare beyond that?\nI was my college newspaper editor. My wife and I bought our local hometown newspaper, but not because we're making any money off of it. Because we believe in local journalism. We need journalists, and we need academics, and we need researchers, and we can't have new technology just strangle the business model of that.\nPersonally, that's my motivation from a company perspective. Like this is an existential threat to us. If the internet stops existing, what's left for Cloudflare to do? So one of the things that is really important to us is a thriving and vibrant internet ecosystem. Even if it didn't contribute a single dollar in revenue to us.\nBut it's contributing revenue to us already because we're seeing folks like your parent company and others who are saying, “This is important, and we were using someone else and now we're shifting to Cloudflare.”\nI want to ask you a little bit about a different aspect of what you guys do. So you have this massive network, right? One hundred and twenty-five countries. You released an outage summary on internet blockages or interruptions around the world and found that there were no government-directed outages in the first three months of this year, but the second three months were a different story. Can you talk a little bit about what you’re seeing?\nIt's interesting how there's a seasonality to this and that seasonality happens for what is a pretty silly reason in my estimation. There are a lot of countries in the world that believe access to the internet gives students an unfair advantage if they're taking standardized tests.\nOh, really?\nSo at the end of the school year, you'll see a massive uptick in the internet being turned off in those countries to deny access to students to be able to cheat on the tests. What's depressing about that? First, they've designed tests that you can cheat on so easily just by having access to the internet. Second, we see it being turned off in those countries in poor regions but left on in rich regions. Which is a way that powerful people are helping their own kids but punishing the poorer kids.\nBut what worries me the most is that it's normalizing the idea that it's OK for the government, for what is a relatively silly reason, to turn off the internet and that they have essentially built the tooling to be able to do that on the back of “we must protect the children.”\nThat same tooling—whenever there’s an election and they want to suppress any kind of other party that might kick them out of power, whenever there’s any sort of civil unrest or protests, they can use that same tooling.\nThat is fascinating. I have to ask, in the context of the US administration right now, have you seen any changes in the online environment since Trump took office?\nNo is the answer. We had a great relationship with the Obama administration. We had a great relationship with the first Trump administration. We had a great relationship with the Biden administration. We have, so far, had a great relationship with the second Trump administration.\nIt's in the US’s interest for there to be more global internet access. If there is a change, the one place where I think that there has been what we view as a positive change has been that some of the internet blocking or restrictions or what we saw out of the UK where they were trying to force back doors into encryption, some aspects of the Trump administration, the current State Department, have said that's actually a trade issue. So I actually think that the current Trump administration has been more aggressive at protecting the internet than we saw from the Biden administration.\nWhen you think about everything that your company is across, what is it that's waking you up at 3 in the morning right now? What do you worry about?\nThe business model of the internet is breaking, and if content creators don't have an incentive to create content, if they can't get famous and they can't get rich, they're just going to stop creating content. That's an existential threat. That's the nightmare, the dream that wakes me up.\nWhat makes you excited? What are you optimistic about?\nSo we, for the first time in human history, have a relatively good mathematical model. To describe the totality of human knowledge, it's not perfect. But if you take all the AI companies that are out there, they have these giant decision trees that they've created. It’s the best representation of human knowledge that we've ever had, and it tells us what we know, but it also tells us what we don't know. I analogize it to being like a giant block of Swiss cheese. There's a lot of cheese, but there's a bunch of holes in that cheese.\nThe thing that actually makes me super optimistic is that if we do this right, creating a set of incentives that reward content creators for filling in the holes, that is a lot better business model and a much healthier business model than the old traffic generation.\nMy evidence that we're onto something is we've seen a handful of content deals, and the company that has gotten the best deal by far is Reddit. We know from their public filings that last year they got close to $140 million a year from Google and OpenAI.\nHmm.\nIf you compare that with a similar deal that was done for The New York Times, they got about $20 million. So Reddit got seven times more than The New York Times. Why? Well, maybe it's crazy …\nI think I know where you're going, and I'm gonna agree with you, but [$140 million compared to $20 million is] a wildly different number.\nYeah. But 20 minutes ago we both, I think, agreed that we're nostalgic for the quirky internet ...\nOh, I love Reddit.\n… and there's nothing that represents that more than Reddit. The New York Times is amazing, but if you have data from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, like how much real difference is there? Basically the facts stay the same between those, whereas Reddit is this unique content, and so we already have some evidence that the business model of the AI-driven web is going to be one that rewards the Reddits of the world more.\nAll right. I gotta figure out what hole in the Swiss cheese I'm gonna fill.\nYou know, the scariest meeting I’ve had in the last little bit was coffee with Anna Wintour. My wife was like, “You have to wear a suit.” And I’m like, “I don’t have anything.”\nWait. This is really important. What did you wear, Matthew?\nIt was in New York and it was a hundred degrees outside, a hundred percent humidity. The only suit I had was this light blue, fall, relatively heavy suit. So, I wore the suit.\nOh boy.\nAnna probably rolled her eyes at this. But I also was just a sweaty mess. So I think it was a pretty embarrassing meeting.\nThis is a shocking visual. I'm sure she thought it went great. The thing about my boss is that she's actually really, really nice. So there you go.\nShe was incredibly, incredibly lovely, and so thoughtful about the whole content and media industry. So I really appreciated the opportunity to get to pick her brain.\nThat's really funny.\nEven though my sartorial sense is pretty …\nTrust me, so is mine. I know the feeling.\nBefore we end, I wanna play a little game we came up with. It's called Control, Alt, Delete. What piece of tech would you love to control? What piece would you alt, so alter or change, and what would you delete? What would you vanquish from the Earth if given the opportunity?\nSo, delete. I'd probably say TikTok. Zero protein, very low-value content, I think, is really dangerous and damaging.\nUm, control. I feel super privileged in terms of what we do at Cloudflare, so I would love to have significant influence in thinking through what the next business model of the web looks like. I don't necessarily wanna control it, but I would love to at least control making sure that we're rewarding filling the holes in the cheese.\nThen, alt. I'm still longing for a home automation system that doesn't suck. Because I showed up at my house in Austin and the light switches didn't work and I couldn't turn the TV on. You know, a smart home that was a little bit smarter.\nYou can always listen to this week's podcast through the audio player on this page, but if you want to subscribe for free to get every episode, here's how:\nIf you're on an iPhone or iPad, open the app called Podcasts, or just tap this link.

    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/22-cell-towers-one-vigilante-world-of-conspiracies/",
    "content": "As dawn spread over San Antonio on September 9, 2021, almond-colored smoke began to fill the sky above the city’s Far West Side. The plumes were whorling off the top of a 132-foot-tall cell tower that overshadows an office park just north of SeaWorld. At a hotel a mile away, a paramedic snapped a photo of the spectacle and posted it to the r/sanantonio subreddit. “Cell tower on fire around 1604 and Culebra,” he wrote.\nIn typical Reddit fashion, the comments section piled up with corny jokes. “Blazing 5G speeds,” quipped one user.\n“I hope no one inhales those fumes, the Covid transmission via 5G will be a lot more potent that way,” wrote another, in a swipe at the conspiracy theorists who claim that radiation from 5G towers caused the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe wisecracks went on: “Can you hear me now?”\n“Free hotspot!”\n“Great, some hero trying to save us from 5G.”\nThat self-styled hero was actually lurking in the comments. As he followed the thread on his phone, Sean Aaron Smith delighted in the sheer volume of attention the tower fire was receiving, even if most of it dripped with sarcasm. A lean, tattooed—and until recently, entirely apolitical—27-year-old, Smith had come to view 5G as the linchpin of a globalist plot to zombify humanity. To resist that supposed scheme, he’d spent the past five months setting Texas cell towers ablaze.\nSmith’s crude and quixotic campaign against 5G was precisely the sort of security threat that was fast becoming one of the US government’s top concerns in 2021. Just two weeks after Smith’s fire popped up on Reddit, then FBI director Christopher Wray discussed the latest trends in political violence in a speech marking the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. “Today, the greatest terrorist threat we face here in the US is from what are, in effect, lone actors,” he said, describing these people as moving “quickly from radicalization to action, often using easily obtainable weapons against soft targets.” And an increasing number of these individuals, Wray stressed, were turning violent after marinating in bizarre conspiracy theories.\nIn the years since Wray first delivered that warning, political violence in the US has continued to evolve much as he foresaw. Numerous recent attacks have been launched by people whose media diets have conditioned them to believe that government oppressors, permissive liberals, or shadowy cabals must be stopped at all costs. “This conspiracy stuff, it’s not coming from HitlerLover4Chan88 on Twitter anymore,” says Jonathan Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. “It’s coming from a blue check, a gold check, a verified account—someone who, for a lot of people, has legitimacy.” He adds that some of those paranoid influencers are even operating in the halls of power. “You’ve got Groypers running Department of Homeland Security Twitter accounts,” Lewis says. “You’re getting legislative bills being passed about climate modification.”\nIt all started when a videoclip from episode 1,308 of The Joe Rogan Experience popped up in Smith’s Instagram feed.\nOnce convinced that violence is the only moral choice, lone actors are routinely carrying out hit-and-run attacks against pieces of the nation’s technological infrastructure, which remain lightly guarded despite their vast importance. The types of sites being targeted are as varied as the causes that motivate their attackers. In 2022, for example, someone shot up two electrical substations in North Carolina, in a possible far-right effort to disrupt a drag show. Two years later, a Tennessee man was arrested for allegedly plotting to use drones to bomb Nashville’s power grid in hopes of hastening a race war. This past July, a member of a militia group that trafficked in weather-manipulation conspiracy theories allegedly smashed up an Oklahoma radar station. And saboteurs with unknown motives have also been severing fiber-optic cables in both California and Missouri since the early summer. (Gauging the true number of infrastructure attacks has become more difficult since the DHS shuttered its Terrorism and Targeted Violence database in March.)\nBut Smith—who planned and executed his arsons by himself—appears to have been more prolific than any of these other extremists. The blaze north of SeaWorld was the seventh he’d set in 2021; in the seven months that followed, he would burn another 15. I spent the past year talking to Smith at length about the origin and details of his anti-5G crusade. I did so in the hope of learning how and why some desperate souls are being lured into destroying the guts of modern life.\nSmith grew up in a three-bedroom trailer in northwest San Antonio, the only child of a carpenter and a nurse’s assistant. He entered high school with dreams of making a career in the military, but his life swerved when his father slipped into alcoholism after a construction accident. With his dad lost in the haze of drink and his mother rarely home due to her 12-hour work shifts, Smith searched elsewhere for belonging. He dropped out of high school in the 10th grade to devote himself to a new group of friends whose sole interests were drugs and petty crime. “The attention they gave me inspired a fierce loyalty,” he says. “There’s not much I wouldn’t do for them.” At the age of 18, he went to prison for burglarizing a house while blacked out on Xanax. He would spend the bulk of the next six years behind bars after blowing parole and picking up multiple drug and firearm charges; his father died of cancer while he was locked up.\nWhen Smith was paroled from his third prison stint in November 2019, he resolved to make a break with his troubled past. He moved back into his mother’s trailer and landed a cooking job at Golden Corral. He also started a relationship with 18-year-old Coley Lane Dupre, a former elite gymnast who’d recently turned rebellious; she had moved next door to Smith after walking out of drug rehab. All was going smoothly until March 2020, when the pandemic shuttered Smith’s restaurant and the gymnastics studio where Dupre coached. Their new lives were forced into suspended animation, leaving the couple to fill the days with getting high and scrolling.\nDuring one of those bleary sessions, a videoclip from episode 1,308 of The Joe Rogan Experience, which had originally aired in June 2019, popped up in Smith’s Instagram feed. The clip begins with Rogan pausing to light a joint, which gives his guest—Eddie Bravo, an anvil-headed jiujitsu master known for spouting conspiracies about 9/11 and a flat Earth—the opportunity to pose a question: “What do you think of, um, 5G and all that scare? You think that’s legit?” Rogan pronounces himself “terrified” of the wireless networking technology, which was then starting to become widespread in the US. “How much long-term testing have they done?” he asks, without specifying the potential effects he fears. “Zero?” Bravo then urges Rogan to visit a website that contains the government’s “400-page plan for the world,” a document that he says contains revelations about 5G that will “get your fucking head blown off.”\nThe clip was short on details, but it reminded Smith of a man he’d befriended in prison in 2014. This inmate had been an avid reader of books about magnets and electricity, and he’d often rambled about a sprawling communications “grid” that he said was being built for nefarious reasons. Smith had never paid much attention to these convoluted rants, but the two famous podcasters seemed to be echoing his friend’s concerns.\nWhen he plugged queries about 5G into search bars, Smith quickly became alarmed. Social media was awash in posts asserting that 5G towers, which use higher electromagnetic frequencies than their 4G forerunners, had weakened human immune systems, leaving them unable to fend off the Covid-19 virus. (Several nations where 5G was not yet available in 2020, such as Iran, were among the most devastated by Covid.) Prominent figures like the actor Woody Harrelson claimed on Insta-gram (falsely) that China was dismantling its 5G towers to curb Covid’s spread. As Smith’s social-media algorithms adjusted to his affinity for these posts, he became aware that arsonists in the United Kingdom had set fire to more than 60 cell towers in the spring of 2020. This spate of violence had been inspired in part by the YouTube sermons of a British pastor and crypto consultant who preached that “the radio frequencies we are being exposed to are killing the people.” (The pastor gained legitimacy by claiming to be a former executive at Vodafone; he had in fact been a salesman for the telecommunications company for less than a year, well before the rollout of 5G.)\nSmith’s suspicions only deepened when he noticed that his favorite 5G content often vanished within hours of being posted. “If you said anything connecting 5G with Covid, you were censored, Facebook is taking your post down, it was fact-checking you,” he says. “And I’m like, why are they so worried about censoring people on the subject? And that’s kind of what resonated with me.” Smith concluded that powerful forces were concealing the insidious truth about 5G.\nWith no shot at landing another restaurant gig in the midst of the pandemic, Smith backslid into selling drugs as the spring of 2020 wore on. He roamed San Antonio’s eerily deserted streets, delivering cannabis, cocaine, and other intoxicants to customers hunkered down in their homes. During his rounds, he noticed that 5G towers were some of the only structures still being built. He occasionally pulled over to ask construction workers why they were risking illness and death to expand the rollout of 5G. When they told him to scram, he considered their rudeness yet another red flag.\nWhen Smith wasn’t out dealing, he was usually alone in the trailer with Dupre—his mother was working even crazier hours than usual at a hospital flooded with Covid patients. The couple would watch videos from InfoWars impresario Alex Jones and the British conspiracy theorist David Icke, the latter of whom is notorious for claiming the world is secretly controlled by reptilian humanoids. These sources were now espousing increasingly dark and elaborate stories about 5G that portrayed the technology as central to a scheme to enslave entire nations. One popular narrative held that governments had unleashed the Covid-19 virus to force people into isolation, thereby giving construction crews the time and space to build out 5G networks. When a vaccine was eventually developed, the radiation from 5G towers would interact with graphene oxide nanomaterials that were integrated into the injections. This would give governments the power to control how their citizens behave or even to annihilate them en masse if they ever revolted. “If 5G continues and reaches where they want to take it,” Icke warned in an April 2020 interview, “human life as we know it is over.”\nAs Smith and Dupre approached the site, they believed they could detect sinister waves of energy wafting through the air.\nThis story, often peddled by people who sold garments or knickknacks that purported to repel 5G radiation, made perfect sense to Smith. He’d formerly never had a shred of interest in politics—“My mindset was always, oh, it has nothing to do with me,” he says—but the technophobic content he was now consuming had melted his apathy. “The way that China is right now with the technology and the surveillance, I saw America turning into the same thing eventually,” he says. “Our freedoms deleted, stuff like that.” He made Dupre similarly fearful by showing her several patents that employ the phrase “voice to skull,” which the couple interpreted as evidence that the government could use 5G to implant thoughts in an unsuspecting populace. (The patents in question do not make this claim.)\nOn the evening of Friday, July 17, Smith was en route to a customer’s house when the police pulled him over for a routine traffic stop. He was arrested for drug and firearm possession, two charges that seemed certain to result in the revocation of his parole and a return to prison. But Smith realized that he probably wouldn’t be cited for a parole violation until court reopened on Monday morning. So Dupre scraped together enough money to bail him out on Saturday, and the couple went on the run.\nThe grim realities of life on the lam complicated Smith and Dupre’s efforts to further their study of 5G. They mostly crashed in local drug houses, where Smith’s profession always made him a welcome presence at first. But something would inevitably go awry after a few days or weeks of rooming with mercurial meth abusers. Both were assaulted and robbed at gunpoint, and Smith and Dupre had to flee one toxic situation after another.\nAs the stress of being a fugitive chipped away at Smith’s psyche, he pondered how to recapture a sense of purpose. “I wanted to be a better person,” he says. “I’m still doing these things, I’m still in this lifestyle. But part of me was wanting to help people.” In late November, he decided to take a new step: Instead of passively absorbing information pushed to him by podcasters and algorithms, he would investigate a 5G tower in the wild.\nSmith and Dupre spent a night combing San Antonio for a tower to explore. Most of the structures were inaccessible, protected by chain-link fences topped with razor wire. But the couple finally found an unsecured tower tucked away in a suburban neighborhood. As they approached the site, they were frightened by its loud and eerie hum. (The noise from 5G towers is generated by cooling fans and electrical components.) They believed they could detect sinister waves of energy wafting through the air. Dupre was so rattled by the tower’s aura that she couldn’t bring herself to touch it. “Babe, it feels ugly,” she said to Smith as she turned away.\nSmith pressed forward, however, and laid hands on the tower’s cylindrical metal base. In that moment, he was overwhelmed by sadness at how many people were ignorant of these monstrosities in their midst. “That’s when I really made the decision,” he recalls. “I snapped. Like, man, I’m going to do something about this.”\nNow that they’d resolved to swing into action, Smith and Dupre discussed how best to battle 5G. They toyed with the idea of launching their own podcast or educational website. But they settled on producing homemade batches of so-called orgonite crystals, which are touted in alternative-medicine circles as having the ability to dampen electromagnetic fields. In the cluttered kitchens of the drug houses where they were hiding, the couple filled muffin tins with tinted resins and snippets of whatever metal they could find—curls of steel wool, coils of copper wire. These would harden into translucent lumps that Smith and Dupre began placing next to San Antonio’s 5G towers, an act of subversion they called “gifting.” Dupre took to creating crystals shaped like hearts or flowers, which she handed out to strangers in the hopes of opening their eyes to the horrors of 5G.\nBut Smith quickly soured on gifting as too tepid an approach. He was becoming increasingly radicalized as he learned about individuals who’d made tremendous sacrifices to oppose mobile technology. He particularly admired John Robert Patterson, an Australian telecommunications technician who believed he’d suffered adverse health consequences from overexposure to electromagnetic fields. In 2007, Patterson infamously stole an armored personnel carrier and used it to ram seven mobile towers in Sydney before surrendering to police. The rampage did nothing to slow the growth of Australia’s wireless industry, but Smith liked how Patterson kept preaching about a massive cover-up of mobile technology’s hazards even after leaving prison.\nSmith also paid close attention to the December 25, 2020, bombing in downtown Nashville, during which a loner named Anthony Quinn Warner blew himself up in an RV. The FBI concluded that Warner was motivated by both suicidal desperation and an incoherent set of conspiracy theories, including his belief that the government has been covering up an alien invasion. But Smith focused only on the fact that Warner chose to detonate his vehicle in front of an AT&T network facility—proof, he thought, that 5G was the real intended target.\nIn February 2021, a massive ice storm knocked out much of the power in San Antonio for days. Smith took advantage of the blackout to trespass at several 5G towers, using bolt cutters to slice through their fences. He studied the fiber-optic cables that extended out of the facilities’ base stations and ran for yards in the open before snaking into the towers’ access hatches. He realized it would be easy to set those exposed cables on fire. He imagined the flames racing up the towers’ innards and consuming the antennas located a hundred feet or more above the ground, transforming them into torches that would mesmerize San Antonians. “I didn’t have any other way to try to get people’s attention,” he says. “I thought maybe, hey, if I burn this over here, maybe someone will see it and be like, ‘Hey, why is someone burning these down?’ And they’d look into it.”\nOn the morning of April 10, Smith pulled up to a 5G tower behind a discount eyeglass shop; he’d picked the location so he could make a quick getaway via I-410 across the street. He lit the fuse of a crudely assembled Molotov cocktail and tossed it over the fence. To his dismay, the makeshift bomb landed a bit wide of the cables, causing only minor damage after smashing apart on the ground. Smith fled the scene in such haste that he dropped his lime-green lighter. As he peeled out toward the freeway, he knew he’d have to hone his methods if he was serious about changing the world.\nTo become a better arsonist, Smith trekked into a barren corner of the South Texas countryside to run some tests. He tried out grenade-like devices filled with homemade napalm, which he made using a recipe he’d found on the internet. But he ultimately determined that he’d never achieve his desired results by throwing incendiary devices from a fence line—the failure rate would be too high, regardless of the bombs’ design. He instead needed to break into the tower sites so he could burn the cables up close. That would mean spending five minutes or more on the scene, thereby exposing himself to detection and arrest.\nSmith came up with a simple yet effective modus operandi that would minimize his odds of getting caught. He would scout targets using Google Earth, zeroing in on towers next to wooded areas where he could retreat after setting a fire. He also obtained a wardrobe of costumes he could wear to make it seem like he belonged inside a tower’s perimeter—he stockpiled construction-worker outfits and security-guard uniforms, most of which he acquired in exchange for drugs. As long as he could get away with using his bolt cutters on the fences, no one was likely to question him as he knelt next to the towers and covertly stuffed their cable hatches with accelerant-soaked rags.\nSmith became a rather busy arsonist starting that April: Over an initial six-week period, he hit one tower by a tattoo shop, another outside an upscale apartment complex, and a third at the end of a residential cul-de-sac. Dupre accompanied him on the last of these missions, but she couldn’t bring herself to shimmy through the hole in the fence that Smith had cut. Unlike her boyfriend, she was scared to dirty her hands with actual property destruction.\nAfter this nerve-racking experience, Dupre pleaded with Smith to halt his arson spree. She did so in part because things were finally looking up for the couple: Thanks to a reference from a prominent San Antonio rapper he knew, Smith had landed an off-the-books job as a handyman at a small commercial building, and the landlord was letting him and Dupre stay in one of the vacant units. Dupre didn’t want Smith to ruin this semi-stable situation by bringing more heat on himself. But Smith was now too deep in the throes of anti-5G fervor. “It gave me meaning,” he says of the fires. “It gave my life more of a meaning, being able to fight against something.”\nSmith liked the idea of going down in a blaze of glory, of martyring himself for the anti-5G cause.\nIn late May, Smith set out to torch a tower in the neighborhood of Oak Hills. Perhaps overconfident after having eluded capture for so long, Smith lingered for a while before lighting the gasoline-soaked rags he’d stuffed in the cable hatch. When he finally flicked his lighter, he accidentally ignited the fumes that had built up in the enclosed space. The flames whooshed back into his face, burning off much of his hair and turning his flesh a cherry red.\nSmith stumbled away in agony, knowing that he couldn’t go to an emergency room for help. In a panic he called Dupre, who was working the late shift at a 7-11. She grabbed several jugs of water, locked the store behind her, and sprinted back to the apartment to tend to her boyfriend’s wounds. The couple eventually felt they had no choice but to call Smith’s mother, who put herself in legal jeopardy by coming over to provide care.\nFor much of the summer, Smith feared that the physical damage he’d suffered was permanent. Yet even before his face regained its normal complexion and his eyebrows began to resprout, he felt compelled to get back to his arson campaign. Now more cognizant of the risk of self-immolation, he looked for safer ways to start his fires. He found good advice on the website for WarriorUp, a “research project” dedicated to sharing “techniques for sabotaging capitalist infrastructure and extractive industries.” Taking a cue from an article entitled “How to Destroy Cell Phone Towers,” Smith cut up an old tire so he could use the shards in lieu of rags—the rubber caught fire more slowly than cloth. (For the same reason, he also switched to using diesel as his preferred accelerant.)\nDuring one of his attacks, Smith snagged a souvenir that caught his eye: a warning sign that read, “Radio frequency fields near some antennas may exceed the FCC occupational rules for human exposure.” The Federal Communications Commission mandates the posting of these signs for the benefit of maintenance workers who must occasionally climb to the peaks of towers. But Smith mistakenly thought this language amounted to a government confession that civilians within a wide radius of a tower are in constant danger. He delighted in showing off the sign when evangelizing to fellow miscreants about 5G’s role in transforming the US into a repressive dystopia. He could only hope his audiences were listening more intently to his lectures than he’d listened to his prison friend back in 2014.\nJesse Moncada, the lead arson investigator for the San Antonio Fire Department, wasn’t terribly concerned when he inspected the singed 5G tower behind My Econo’s $39.95 Optical on April 10, 2021. Whoever had started the fire that morning was clearly an amateur—their Molotov cocktail hadn’t packed much punch, and they’d foolishly dropped their lime-green lighter at the scene. His best guess was that the culprit was a vagrant bent on causing minor trouble.\n“But then it happened again,” says Moncada, who joined the fire department in 2001. “And we started seeing the same pattern and same modes of burning.” Curious as to why someone would be fixated on destroying 5G towers, he contacted the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for assistance. The agency told him about the cell-tower fires that had occurred in the UK in April 2020, a brief criminal epidemic that had made US federal authorities aware that conspiracy-driven terrorism would inevitably be on the rise. “We assess that violent extremists probably will target a range of telecommunications infrastructure,” the Department of Homeland Security had warned in a May 2020 memo. “More coordinated attacks by multiple individuals in adjacent areas could amplify these incidents.” The document also noted that these extremists were likely to be influenced by a hodgepodge of beliefs: Some would be white nationalists who’d been chattering online about their opposition to Covid restrictions, while others would be radical environmentalists who’d embraced the anti-technology manifesto of the Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski.\nNow aware that he was likely dealing with a form of terrorism rooted in online disinformation, Moncada had fingerprints lifted off the lighter he’d found at the first crime scene. They matched those of Smith, who had been wanted on a fugitive felony warrant since the previous July. At another burnt tower, Moncada also found a black glove that contained flecks of Smith’s DNA. But it was one thing to know the arsonist’s identity, quite another to find him: Smith was a ghost drifting through San Antonio’s underworld, leaving few if any traces as he cycled through an endless stream of prepaid phones.\nHoping to glean a license plate number or accomplice’s description that might help reveal Smith’s location, Moncada contacted the security teams at affected companies such as Verizon and T-Mobile. “But what made it difficult was they didn’t want anybody to know that their towers were being damaged,” he says. “I didn’t get enough help from them. So it was difficult for me to put everything together, because I didn’t have any video footage or witnesses.”\nBy the spring of 2022, the number of 5G arsons was nearing 20, and Moncada began collaborating with both the Texas Rangers and the FBI to solve the case. These larger agencies helped process more DNA evidence—at a tower that burned in March 2022, for example, Moncada recovered pubic hairs from a pair of boxer shorts that Smith used to start the fire. But there seemed little chance of stopping the attacks unless Smith made a mistake.\nHis ego inflated by his months of success, Smith took to thinking of himself as an “urban gray man,” capable of committing his arsons with supreme speed and stealth. He would often persuade an unwitting acquaintance to drive him to within a block or two of the tower he’d picked to torch. He’d hop out of the car and say he had to make a quick drug sale, then change into the reflective vest and hard hat that he kept in his backpack. He’d snip the fence, start the fire, and slip into the woods as the flames began to swell. He’d then strip off his construction-worker gear, pull a baseball cap low over his eyes, and circle back to the car as if nothing unusual had happened. As they pulled away, he’d peer out the window at the clouds of smoke now rising above the city.\nSmith’s personal life was growing messy as he became ever more focused on leading the revolution against 5G. He lost his handyman job in early 2022, a development that forced him and Dupre to relocate to a friend’s apartment. The couple’s romance was also beginning to falter, in large part because Dupre had tired of centering her life around the use of Xanax and methamphetamine. “I was miserable,” she says. “I hated every second of it.” Smith, meanwhile, started seeing another woman named Callie Holland, who had recently moved down from Missouri with her daughter. On one of their dates, she watched him burn a 5G tower.\nAs he passed the one-year anniversary of his first arson, Smith was feeling nothing short of invincible. On April 29, 2022, he chose to deviate from his usual cautious approach and set fire to a tower next to a heavily trafficked Walmart Supercenter. When Moncada arrived on the scene to investigate, he reviewed the store’s security footage and spotted a red 2017 Chevrolet Cruze zooming out of the parking lot moments after the fire’s ignition. The car was registered to Holland, who had previously been arrested, though not charged, for a drug violation—precisely the sort of person who might run in the same sordid circles as Smith.\nIn the wee hours of May 13, the San Antonio police detained Holland as she left a Mexican restaurant. She admitted that she’d loaned her car to Smith two weeks earlier, and she spilled all she knew about her part-time lover’s crusade. “Holland advised that Smith stated the US government is out to get him and that the 5G towers give off radiation and control minds,” a Texas Ranger wrote in his report. “Holland stated that Smith watches a bunch of videos of 5G towers on YouTube.”\nMost importantly, Holland provided the investigators with a phone number for Smith that was only a week old—a critical piece of information that Moncada had been seeking for months. By noon that day, Moncada had obtained a warrant to “ping” Smith’s phone—that is, to triangulate its location using the same towers that Smith reviled as tools of oppression.\nA US Secret Service agent performed the ping, which indicated that Smith was at an apartment complex behind a Lowe’s home improvement store. A phalanx of police officers, Texas Rangers, and FBI agents immediately descended on the area in search of the arsonist who had set fire to 22 5G towers since April 2021.\nAt 1:20 pm that afternoon, Smith emerged from his apartment and hopped into a friend’s Cadillac CTS. As they rolled away from the curb, the car was surrounded by dozens of law enforcement agents with handguns and rifles drawn.\nSmith had always known this day would come, and he’d often contemplated how he would react. He liked the idea of going down in a blaze of glory, of martyring himself for the anti-5G cause—there was romance in the concept of becoming a more extreme figure in technophobic lore than the Australian who’d bulldozed the Sydney towers. Given that he was armed with a loaded handgun, that outcome was certainly an option. But in the face of such an awesome amount of firepower pointed right at him, Smith froze.\n“This is the happiest I’ve ever been.”\nSmith could tell I looked quizzical when I heard him utter those words, and he quickly qualified his statement by adding, “I know that sounds crazy.” The place where we were meeting, the visiting room of a desolate south Texas prison, was entirely devoid of cheer. But Smith, whose forehead still bears scars from a long-ago pistol whipping, explained that despite his grim surroundings, he has never felt better. Drug-free for the first time in ages, he now spends his days studying college-level chemistry, reading the philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and listening to political podcasts like Pod Save America. He counts himself blessed that he didn’t choose to commit suicide-by-cop. “I needed a wake-up call,” he says. “I needed to get away from everything and rethink everything and have a chance to sit down and reevaluate.”\nHe also considers himself fortunate to have a shot at leaving prison before his 40th birthday. After he pleaded guilty to six counts of arson in federal court, prosecutors were keen to turn him into an example and sought a 15-year sentence—far longer than recommended by the advisory guidelines. “The sentencing guidelines do not contemplate a 22-tower arson spree meant to shut down the cellphone system to follow a bizarre anti-government philosophy,” wrote the lead prosecutor, who specializes in counterterrorism cases. “The increased focus and attacks on this critical infrastructure by extremists and conspiracy theorists like the Defendant has the potential to wreak extensive societal damage and disruption.”\nFrightened by the prospect of spending a decade and a half in prison, Smith sent handwritten requests for help to several organizations that he thought might be sympathetic to his plight. The recipients included Children’s Health Defense, a nonprofit founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; Smith knew that at an anti-vaccine rally in early 2022, Kennedy had declared that 5G was designed to “harvest our data and control our behavior.” No one ever replied to Smith’s entreaties, but the judge still cut him a break: He was sentenced to 78 months of federal time, to be served concurrently with a state sentence that’s currently projected to run until 2030. (When he was arrested in May 2022, the fugitive Smith was carrying a half-pound of cannabis in addition to his handgun; he will be eligible for parole on the state charges next year.)\nDupre was arrested for arson, too, after admitting to Moncada that she’d been with Smith when he torched a tower in May 2021. That case was eventually dismissed, however, and Dupre has transformed her life in the time since. Now clean and sober, she trained to become a substance-abuse counselor at San Antonio College and recently took a job at a recovery center. “I need to correct my karma and help other addicts,” she told me.\nShe has extricated herself from the darkness of her former life, but Dupre remains convinced that 5G poses an existential threat. She is far from unique in holding onto that belief. This past June, for example, arsonists set fire to six cell towers in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Other Covid-related conspiracy theories have endured and mutated, too. In June, a Minnesota man was charged with assassinating a state lawmaker and her husband, later saying he had meant to punish those who supported Covid vaccines; later in the summer, an Atlanta man who believed he’d been harmed by one of those vaccines opened fire on the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control, killing a police officer.\n“I don’t know how to say this without sounding crazy, but I just don’t trust the technology,” Dupre says of 5G. “I don’t think that they’re just cell phone towers.” She also has sympathy for the choices made by Smith, with whom she maintains a close platonic friendship: “I support him 100 percent. I’m not saying what he did was right, but I’m not saying it was wrong.”\nSmith maintains his vehement opposition to 5G, but the more pressing object of his concern these days is AI—the newest fixation among young extremists now sprouting from the same media ecosystem that radicalized Smith. “It’s clear to them that AI will be utilized in order for the government to maintain its control, to enhance its ability to surveil, to monitor, to track, to interfere with our privacy,” says Arie Perliger, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell who studies domestic terrorism. Crude individual attacks against AI data centers seem inevitable as the technology increasingly upends the routines of American life. The question is whether such violence will elicit more public sympathy than Smith’s fires, even if perpetrated by militants who espouse outlandish political beliefs; the grain of truth in AI paranoia is many orders of magnitude larger than the one at the core of the anti-5G movement.\n“If I had one message I could communicate about my beliefs, it would be, ‘Why would the most creative and imaginative beings on Earth wish to create something that would make us obsolete?’” Smith told me. Once an enthusiastic supporter of President Trump—he says he nearly went to Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021—he now worries the current administration is glad to let giant AI companies make humans subordinate to machines.\nSmith dreams of launching a podcast about the dangers of technology, though he acknowledges that people will be reluctant to listen to someone with his unsavory background. He insisted to me that he deeply regrets setting his fires, because doing so harmed his ability to become a trusted political voice. Yet toward the end of our time together in Texas, Smith asked if I wanted to see something cool. After making sure no guards were watching, he rose from his seat and smiled as he hiked up the left pant-leg of his white prison jumpsuit. Splashed across his entire calf was a beautifully rendered tattoo that he’d recently had inked by a fellow inmate. It shows a 5G tower engulfed in flames.\nLet us know what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor at mail@wired.com."

    "content": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nAmazon Prime Day is one of the most confusing shopping holidays in existence: It’s rarely even a “day,” since in the past it has run from two to four days long. We closely track the best Prime Day deals. Amazon promises “millions of deals”—but the displayed discounts are often misleading, and while it’s advertised as a members-only event, some deals are available to people who don’t subscribe to Prime. Add in the frenzy of limited-time Lightning Deals and you’ve got a recipe perfect for spending too much money.\nFear not! We’re here to help. WIRED’s Reviews team is familiar with common shopping pitfalls, and I’ve been a deals writer for over a decade. What time do sales start and end? How do you tell whether a deal is actually a deal? We pooled our collective expertise to get you prepared for the latest Amazon Prime Day, Amazon Prime Big Deal Days, October 8 and 9.\nAmazon Prime Day has a main sale in July and a secondary sale—previously called “Prime Big Deal Days”—that tends to fall in October. This year it will be on October 8 and 9.\nThe event always kicks off at 3 am Eastern time (midnight Pacific). WIRED will cover the best Prime Day deals from both Amazon and retailers that have competing sales.\nOfficially, yes. You need to be an Amazon Prime member to shop the Amazon Big Deal Days event. There is a free 30-day trial available for new accounts. (Prime membership comes with a lot of perks, and we've rounded up all of them here.) The trial will let you get in on the sale—just remember to cancel your membership to avoid any subsequent $14 monthly renewal charges.\nThere are usually some discounts available if you're not a subscriber (although those deals might not be that great). Other major retailers like Best Buy and Walmart usually hold concurrent sales during Prime-exclusive sales events. The prices are often close to what Amazon is offering on the same products, and sometimes the competing sales match the Prime Day price. This is a good way to take part in the sale if you object to shopping on Amazon.\nIt depends. For some items, Prime-exclusive event prices tend to be among the lowest we see all year. That's especially true for Amazon hardware, like Kindles, Fire Tablets, Fire TV Sticks, and Echo devices. The kicker is that prices on nearly everything fluctuate throughout the year, and some products are discounted on a frequent basis. Even if the price is good, a deal on a product that goes on sale all the time diminishes the overall quality of that offer.\nThe sheer volume of deals promoted by Amazon during sales like Prime Day and Prime Big Deal Days is a blessing and a curse. The truly standout discounts can be difficult to pinpoint—there's so much stuff on sale that the big picture can feel overwhelming. But if you're in the market for something specific, there's a good chance the item you want will be discounted. We've seen some fantastic Prime-exclusive discounts in the past, ranging from dirt-cheap Kindles and video doorbells to elusive price drops on gaming consoles or office furniture. The tricky part is to find the diamonds in the rough.\nWIRED covers legitimately good deals all year long, including during Prime Day. Our policy is to only cover deals on products someone from our team has personally used, to avoid promoting cheap junk. Maybe it'll be a product we've reviewed, or maybe it'll be a product we use in our day-to-day lives. We also only cover actual deals—if the price isn't lower than it normally is, we don't include it. We aim to provide pricing context as well. Our tips below will help you find those great discounts on your own—in the same ways that we would. No gatekeeping here.\nAsk Alexa's Echo Dot for the time and weather, and to play music. Also, a pro tip: You can use it in the kitchen as a timer while cooking.\nABC: Always be checking (prices, that is). Researching an item's price is the most important aspect of determining the quality of a discount. Don't fall prey to deceptive marketing language and inflated MSRP prices—our tips only take a few moments. The easiest step is to take a second to Google the items you're considering so you can see the price across multiple stores.\nOne tool we like to use is Camelcamelcamel, which tracks Amazon's prices over time. Paste the Amazon link or ASIN (found in the Product Information section on the Amazon product page) into Camelcamelcamel's search bar and you'll be able to see an item's lowest recorded price, its average price, and how frequently the price fluctuates. Some deals, such as Lightning Deals, are excluded from the pricing history, but it works for most items. It's useful to see what an item has sold for in the past. And while Amazon's Rufus chatbot has price history information, it isn't always reliable and often misses context (as evinced by our personal testing). We also like Keepa, which has an extension (available for multiple browsers) that shows the recent price history for products directly on the Amazon page so you don't have to open a new tab.\nKeep in mind that these services may not work all the time. But being able to see how much a product costs right before the sale starts (and whether the MSRP happened to increase) can be helpful. Putting these tools together can help you deduce whether a deal is worth your money.\nWIRED always fact-checks deals to determine their quality. Of course, I'm biased, but you can check out our ongoing deals coverage to find roundups of the best discounts available—during Prime Day and year-round.\nAmazon's Kindles are the best e-readers around. Also, waterproof!\nLightning Deals are limited-time deals that Amazon runs for only a few hours. They're not restricted to Prime Big Deal Days, but they're especially prevalent during major sales events. Once an item sells out, you may be able to join a waiting list, but not always.\nPut bluntly, the Lightning Deals selection is often full of impulse buys, like makeup and skin-care products or toys. Prime members can browse upcoming deals on Amazon's website and in the mobile app. The app can also alert you before a Lightning Deal begins. We'll share some of our favorite Lightning Deals in a live blog during the event this year.\nThe best deals sometimes sell out quickly. To get around this, Amazon launched an invite-only deals program during Prime Day. Prime members can request an invitation to purchase items that are expected to go out of stock. This feature is only available on select products, but it's spread across a wide range of price points and categories—including kitchen, electronics, fashion, and beauty.\nOn the deal page, you'll see a Request Invite button on the right-hand side. Click it to get a chance to buy it at the sale price, but just keep in mind that there's no guarantee you'll be invited. According to an Amazon spokesperson, the company removes “botlike submissions” from the list of requests and selects from the remaining customers. However, it's not clear how Amazon chooses from the remaining list of interested buyers.\nIf you're selected, you'll receive both an email and a notification via the Amazon app once Prime Day begins. The offer is usually valid until Prime Day ends, so you'll have a limited window of time to make your purchase.\nThe biggest appeals of the Echo Pop are easily the fun colors and interesting form factor. Also, it's a great little speaker that is usually $40.\nIf you know what time a deal begins, make sure to pay attention to the product page around the starting time. You may also be able to add an item to your cart before the sale begins, so you can refresh the page to snag it right away. With the Amazon Shopping app (Android, iOS), you can set up personalized deal alerts to get notified when items you have searched for recently are on sale, but only if you're a Prime member.\nIt's smart to create an account at trusted retailers so you can save your credit card information and shipping details ahead of time. This will make the checkout process as fast as possible. It's also a good idea to clear your web browser cache before you start shopping during sales events like Prime Big Deal Days. Just be sure to log back in to those retailers afterward.\nIf a deal does sell out, there's a high chance another store will be offering a similar or matching discount. Check other stores, especially big-box merchants like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy. Sometimes expired deals can come back in stock too.\nThe third-generation Echo Show 8 is the best choice for most people, our WIRED reviewers say. From weather to recipes, this will be an APD deal.\nIt's easy to fall into a trap during events like Prime Big Deal Days or other shopping holidays. You might see a great deal on a product you don't really need. Don't do it. Make a list of items you've actually been wanting to buy ahead of the event and save those links. When Prime Day begins, take a look around to see whether they're on sale, and use the aforementioned practices to make sure it truly is a good deal. Then buy it! Don't buy a product just because it has a nice price.\nThis isn't your only chance to score a great deal this year. The last big sale events of the year are just around the corner: Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which take place on Thanksgiving weekend. You might see even better price drops then.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore. Subscribe Today."

    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/wired-ai-summit-tech-politics-media/",
    "content": "In an increasingly divided world, one thing that everyone seems to agree on is that artificial intelligence is a hugely disruptive—and sometimes downright destructive—phenomenon.\nAt WIRED’s AI Power Summit in New York on Monday, leaders from the worlds of tech, politics, and the media came together to discuss how AI is transforming their intertwined worlds. The Summit included voices from the AI industry, a current US senator, a former Trump administration official, and publishers including WIRED’s parent company, Condé Nast. You can view a livestream of the event in full below.\n“In journalism, many of us have been excited and worried about AI in equal measure,” said Anna Wintour, Condé Nast’s chief content officer and the global editorial director of Vogue, in her opening remarks. “We worry about it replacing our work, and the work of those we write about.”\nLeaders from the world of politics offered contrasting visions for ensuring AI has a positive impact overall. Richard Blumenthal, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, said policymakers should learn from social media and figure out suitable guardrails around copyright infringement and other key issues before AI causes too much damage. “We want to deal with the perfect storm that is engulfing journalism,” he said in conversation with WIRED global editorial director Katie Drummond.\nIn a separate conversation, Dean Ball, a senior fellow at the Foundation for American Innovation and one of the authors of the Trump administration's AI Action Plan, defended that policy blueprint’s vision for AI regulation. He claimed that it introduced more rules around AI risks than any other government has produced.\nFigures from within the AI industry painted a rosy picture of AI’s impact, too, arguing that it will be a boon for economic growth and would not be deployed unchecked.\n“We have this generational opportunity to reignite American scientific leadership and to renew America’s position as a leader in innovation around the globe,” said Markham C. Erickson, vice president of government affairs and public policy at Google, who mentioned his company’s work applying AI to modeling protein interactions and materials science as signs of such a renaissance.\nErickson downplayed Google’s role in undermining the media industry, even though publishers have seen traffic plummet thanks to tools like AI Overviews, which summarize content instead of sending traffic directly to websites. (AI Overviews still offer links to sources, but publishers have widely reported serious impacts to how many visitors Google sends to their sites since the rollout.) “We want a healthy ecosystem,” said Erickson. “But user preferences, and what users want is also changing.”\nIn a later panel, several media industry leaders argued that Erickson’s rosy analysis underplays a hugely destructive trend.\n“The insinuation that AI Overview is not getting in the way of the 10 blue links and the traffic going back to creators and publishers is just 100 percent false,” said Mike Reed, CEO of Gannett | USA Today Network. “All of the information is out there about how reduced the flow of people is back to sites.” Vox Media cofounder, chair, and CEO Jim Bankoff and People, Inc. CEO Neil Vogel expressed similar sentiments. Reed also announced that Gannett has rolled out its own chatbot-like tool, called DeeperDive, to give its readers the answers they're looking for without having to go to an outside AI company.\nCondé Nast CEO Roger Lynch, who previously worked as CEO of Pandora, drew parallels between the situation that faces online publishers today and when the music industry first forged licensing deals with streaming companies.\n“AI is having a dramatic impact on our industry,” said Lynch. “We are really talking about billions of dollars to compensate industries like ours for one of the most critical inputs for these models, which is the content.”"

This list represents products that WIRED writers have personally used for years, and as the name implies, they should last you for the rest of your life with proper care and warranty support. There's only one coffee maker on that list, the Moccamaster KBGV Select, and you can currently pick it up from Amazon for up to $40 off its list price, depending on the color.\nMoccamaster\nAmazon\nThese drip coffee makers are seriously built to last, handmade in the Netherlands with solid steel and copper components. They're fully repairable, which means they'll keep churning out hot mugs of perfect coffee even after the five-year warranty ends. There are a variety of models, but we like the KBGV Select because it can also brew a half carafe instead of a full carafe, a useful trick for smaller households or an afternoon energy burst.\nExtremely precise temperature control means you get excellent coffee every time, managing to consistently heat within a range of 4 degree Celsius. Technivorm is one of less than a dozen companies producing SCA-certified coffee makers for home use, and the Moccamaster models take up a noticeable chunk of that list.\nIt has all the features you'd expect from a drip coffee maker, like a hot plate for the carafe that has an automatic shut off, which automatically adjusts temperature based on whether you brewed a full or half carafe. The reservoir is 1.25 liters, so you can brew up to 10 cups of coffee at once, and it takes just four to six minutes from start to finish.\nThis model is available in a huge variety of colors, and your discount will vary based on which you think will match your kitchen best. I found the best price of $317 on the Turquoise, with the Apricot and Matte Black right behind at $320, as well as lesser discounts on the Off-White, Polished silver, and Juniper varieties. While we think it's worth spending the extra cash for something that will last you years to come, you can always peruse our other favorite coffee makers if you're looking for something more wallet-friendly."

I'm WIRED's director of business and industry, Zoë Schiffer. Today on the show we're skipping our regular roundup to discuss the news that's gripped the nation since yesterday: the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. On Wednesday, Kirk was fatally shot at an event at Utah Valley University. It was the first appearance of what was supposed to be a nationwide tour aimed at “equipping students with the tools to push back against left-wing indoctrination in academia.” It was hosted by the nonprofit that Kirk founded called Turning Point USA. As of this recording, local and federal authorities are still looking for a suspect. We'll dive into who Kirk was and how he shaped a movement of right-wing digital influencers and commentators that has changed not just conservative media, but US politics at large. I'm joined today by senior politics writer Jake Lahut. Jake, welcome to Uncanny Valley.\nJake Lahut: Hey, Zoë. Good to be back.\nZoë Schiffer: So listeners probably have some idea of who Charlie Kirk was. He is obviously a right-wing activist and a major Trump ally. But take me back to how he became so influential in conservative circles.\nJake Lahut: So Charlie Kirk was basically a teenager and had been planning on going to college. Ends up getting noticed by this guy, Bill Montgomery, who is a conservative activist from Nebraska, and he basically convinces him, in a not-too-dissimilar fashion to a lot of the tech folks that we cover all the time here at WIRED, to say basically, \"Hey, what if you drop out of school and do this full time?\" And in pretty short order, he turned into an absolutely prolific fundraiser, he had very good oratory skills on the stump, and then he developed this brand that we all came to know him by when he became much more famous as the years went on, where he would go to college campuses and basically have a line of students form to debate him. And he basically is the originator of that Prove Me Wrong meme, because that was quite literally his shtick that he had started.\n[Archival audio]: So would you say in some cases women with IUDs are murderers?\nCharlie Kirk [archival audio]: Of course not. They're not murderers. We do not know-\n[Archival audio]: So what's the difference between an IUD killing a conceived zygote and like a mother going into Planned Parenthood and killing the fetus in her womb?\nCharlie Kirk [archival audio]: That was actually the best point somebody made.\nJake Lahut: So that's what Turning Point USA basically set out to do, was to upend the conventional wisdom that Democrats always had an upper hand on college campuses. And it took well over a decade, but they just slowly chipped away at it. And you look at it now, and these events have had huge crowds on college campuses, and Turning Point USA has become both a financial juggernaut and also just a huge grabber of attention for the Republican Party trying to reach young voters.\nZoë Schiffer: Got it. OK, so kind of a true free-speech advocate. The idea being that if you get in there and you debate students and really press them on their ideas, maybe you can change some minds.\nJake Lahut: Yeah, he was definitely after a form of persuasion. Now a lot of the ways he would get into it with students would often be to troll them or humiliate them, and those were certainly, in the attention economy and the way social media works, those are the clips that would often perform the best for him.\nCharlie Kirk [archival audio]: Do you think men can give birth?\n[Archival audio]: I think that-\nCharlie Kirk [archival audio]: Yes or no question.\n[Archival audio]: I think that a person who was assigned male at birth, I don't think they can give birth.\nCharlie Kirk [archival audio]: Assigned male at birth? So people are not male at birth.\n[Archival audio]: I think that a person-\nCharlie Kirk [archival audio]: See, you’re evidence that college is a scam, my friend.\nJake Lahut: I met Kirk at the Republican Convention last year. He had previously invited me to come out to his studio and debate him. I don't really know what the debate would be about because I'm a reporter and didn't have any views I was trying to hash out with the guy. But I really hadn't corresponded with him a ton. And then his reputation did really check out when I met him, which was he had this disarmingly charming affect to him, and he just wanted to have a normal chat off the record. And I think the big thing that he was really known for, among both sources of mine who were friends with him, and the reason why I think a lot of people in the party liked what he had to offer, wasn't just that this is an appeal to younger college student voters or whatever, but he basically made politics more fun for younger conservatives in a way that I think kind of gets overlooked, especially if you're really learning about him only recently or you've only seen some of the more incendiary and hardcore things he said, which was totally part of his identity. But he really did live up to this in-person reputation as being a pretty reasonable guy who genuinely did, almost to a fault, love debating people who disagreed with them.\nZoë Schiffer: Talk to me about what was going on for you yesterday. You've met this person in real life, you've covered politics for a long time. Obviously stuff, to me, seems like it's getting more polarized, more intense, more violent. We're seeing more and more of these incidents. But what was your first impression when the news broke?\nJake Lahut: I immediately thought this was very bad. Someone was asking me, how would you explain this to someone who either just found out about who Charlie Kirk is or else doesn't really know who he is? And I would say, if you're familiar with Rush Limbaugh from his peak as the conservative talk radio host, it's sort of as if a millennial Rush Limbaugh got assassinated, and that the fallout from it and the conspiratorial thinking and the frankly rising tensions around a second civil war would get ramped up really quickly. And I think we have seen that in a lot of corners of the internet, and I know we'll talk about that more on this show, but I just thought, I hope I'm wrong, but it could be a major before-and-after event that we end up looking back on.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, yeah. I saw a lot of that rhetoric, particularly on X, like there's no going back. This is the turning point, not to overuse that term. But one thing that really stuck out to me was we immediately saw high-profile commentators on the left and right condemn the murder wholeheartedly, it felt like. But we also saw prominent right-wing voices that immediately started pointing fingers at the left saying their rhetoric was partly to blame. For example, Elon Musk posted on X that the left is “the party of murder.” What stuck out to you about that? Were you surprised at all?\nJake Lahut: No, a lot of this seemed like a more rapid-fire and sophisticated iteration of what we saw after the assassination attempt on Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania, last summer. And I really can't overstate, I think, how central this is to the modern Trump Republican Party and conservative movement that basically a decade of them being called Nazis and fascists and all this stuff has made life unbearable for them, even though they're in power. It's beyond a sense of being aggrieved. And I think that a lot of these folks legitimately think now that simply being a conservative, being identified as a conservative, saying conservative ideas, makes you a persecuted political class in America. That's genuinely what a lot of them believe. President Trump literally referred to him as a martyr in his remarks yesterday.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, I saw that from a few different people, but Trump most notably. Given who Kirk was and the political reality that we currently live in, that incendiary calls for civil war are not completely shocking, but it's still a situation that has rattled people across the political spectrum. For example, I saw yesterday that Hasan Piker, the left-wing Twitch streamer, has canceled his upcoming appearance at Dartmouth College as a precaution. I'm curious what you make of that and what you'll be keeping an eye out for in the next few weeks.\nJake Lahut: Yeah, actually, Hasan was going to appear with Charlie Kirk at that event at Dartmouth. And this is where things I think could start to, I'm using the term spiral here in the sense of heightened security postures in a way that would effectively lead to less back and forth between voters and politicians, between reporters and politicians. And this is actually something that I'd reported on for us a couple of months back when the Speaker of the Minnesota House was assassinated, and I talked to democratic lawmakers and candidates who said that unfortunately they were looking at spending a lot more money on security and probably either holding none or fewer of the more accessible events at a county fair or somewhere where just regular voters can come up and just chat them up. And I think that we've already seen this trend. And now what I'm wondering is a two-fold thing of a continuation of that trend, and then also an early talking point we're seeing from some conservatives that would effectively designate the Democratic Party as a terrorist organization, and the ramifications of that and what that could have for freedom of elections and what actions that could justify from the administration. I really think it's hard to fathom just how far that could go when we're really only 24 hours out from this as of recording.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, yeah. Some of these ideas sound completely outlandish when you say them, but given the people who are talking about them, it's worth taking somewhat seriously. Coming up after the break, we'll dive into how Kirk shaped a new generation of right-wing figures and influencers who changed conservative media and US politics as we know it. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm Zoë Schiffer and I'm joined today by Senior Politics Writer, Jake Lahut. Jake, we just went through what happened earlier this week in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's death and the responses from the right-wing and beyond. We also touched on how Kirk became renowned for his work with Turning Point USA. One of the main things that the organization has done is prop up and train right-wing influencers. So how much have they actually moved the needle in conservative politics?\nJake Lahut: They've moved the needle quite a bit. Beyond the point I was mentioning earlier about this really monumental effort they undertook to undercut the Democratic Party in terms of enthusiasm and resources deployed to getting college students to vote, they've started to actually scout and develop right-wing talent, and they have one of their blue chip prospects in Congress right now. Anna Paulina Luna from Florida, who I mentioned briefly earlier, got her start as a TPUSA contributor. They've recruited and trained at least 400 influencers since 2019, and it's something akin to a Silicon Valley incubator almost in that sense. And these are names you might've heard of: Alex Clark, Benny Johnson, Candace Owens, and then you have Kirk's prowess as a fundraiser where he was bringing in more than $85 million in the 2024 cycle alone, and that's according to tax records. So I really don't think it can be emphasized enough just how much this strategy has helped Republicans. It culminated in 2024, but it's really better understood as a decade-plus arc that they've been on with making inroads with younger voters.\nZoë Schiffer: So where does that leave traditional right-wing media, like Fox News, for example? Is this a replacement of that or is it working in tandem?\nJake Lahut: I think it's more in tandem. Fox's programming was dominated by Kirk's assassination last night. I think that for a lot of the mainstay Fox personalities, people like Charlie Kirk, and I guess in the Turning Point USA broader cinematic universe, these younger figures are really important, actually, for I think a lot of the more established conservative media TV hosts to build that audience and start to introduce themselves to people who are not throwing on the old-school tube on the couch at home every night. And this is also just something interesting, because Democrats have been trying to do versions of this for a while, and like we mentioned earlier, the conventional wisdom had held that Democrats would always have this advantage of younger voters. So I think it's very interesting to see what Turning Point USA is going to become after this; and then to what extent this door that he opened could be taken up by just a figure with a different kind of profile, a different kind of charisma, maybe more extreme on some issues. So there is a very legitimate, almost a power vacuum that is opened here because he was such a singular figure in this aspect of conservative politics.\nZoë Schiffer: Absolutely. So creating a new branch of right-wing media geared toward a younger audience is definitely a key part of Kirk's legacy. And there's also the legacy that he left in politics at large, like his rhetoric toward trans people, immigrants, his rhetoric on abortion rights. These things really stick out to me. Talk to me about that, that imprint that he might've left.\nJake Lahut: Yeah, I think the imprint has some contradictions that we're seeing in the aftermath of this horrific incident. There's certainly this almost saintly way that he's being painted after his death, and I think part of that is that he was an organizer and not a candidate, so he never got the kind of scrutiny or had to really make hard choices on policy. He was always more in the attention economy realm, the fundraising realm, and the voter turnout area. So I think right now he's being mostly remembered for his genuine commitment to freedom of debate and wanting to actually have uncomfortable in-person interactions with people who may otherwise never talk to each other or disagree about politics. But then you have a lot of the things that he said about gun control, for example, that effectively it is worth having some amount of gun deaths, to paraphrase what he said here, in order to protect the Second Amendment. He was asked one time if one of his daughters, who at the time was 10 years old, that if she were sexually assaulted and became pregnant, would he want her to carry the pregnancy to term? And he basically said yes, that there would have to be a baby there. The other area where I think he may have made the biggest impact, to add real quickly, is that his view of what college and what young adulthood is for, very different than what we've generally heard from younger people involved in politics. He painted a positive vision of going to college for young people. Now, that vision was effectively for women, like you should go to college just to find a husband, and that's pretty much it. But he was offering this view of like, \"Hey, actually you're told in America that your career and hustling and grinding is most important. I'm actually here to tell you that just have a family and have kids.\" And we've seen polling that came out recently from NBC News where Gen Z men ranked having children as their number one priority, and no other demographic did. Whereas Gen Z women listed a litany of other issues ahead of that in terms of having a stable career, mental well-being, all those things. So that's a thread of his legacy that I think is worth keeping track of, because he really was just this one man sensation on the college campuses. And I don't think anyone's going to replace that role right away, but if we want to understand how he really changed our politics beyond looking at one election or a series of quotes he gave, I would look to that, that there are a lot of young people who really admire this guy, who you may know a lot of them, but you just haven't heard from them about it until this happened, and that could very well end up being what the long-term memory of Charlie Kirk is.\nZoë Schiffer: Jake, thank you so much for joining me today.\nJake Lahut: Zoë, thanks so much.\nZoë Schiffer: That's our show for today.

    "title": "Apple MacOS Tahoe 26: Top New Features to Try Today",
    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/macos-26-tahoe-top-features/",
    "content": "I haven’t been excited about a macOS update in a long time, but with macOS Tahoe 26, we're finally getting a significant overhaul. Between the visual redesign (Liquid Glass) and some exciting pro features, there's something for everyone to try out in macOS Tahoe 26, including one feature that Mac nerds will love. I've been using the beta for months, and now that the official release has rolled out, it's time for the wider world to get in on the software changes.\nUpdated September 2025: MacOS 26 Tahoe is officially here. We've included info on what to expect from the update and how to download it.\nIs Your Mac Compatible With MacOS Tahoe?\nIf it's from the past few years, yes. All the Apple Silicon Macs, including the M1 models from 2020, are compatible. However, with macOS Tahoe 26, Apple announced that it is the last update for some Intel-powered Macs.\nThe final supported Intel-based Macs that will receive macOS Tahoe include the following models: MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019), MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2020, Four Thunderbolt 3 ports), iMac (27-inch, 2020), and Mac Pro (2019). So, if you have one of those, you're good to go. You won't be able to try out any of the Apple Intelligence features, as they are still limited to only Apple Silicon.\nHow to Install MacOS Tahoe 26\nNow that Tahoe is officially here, you can upgrade to the latest version right now. As with any software update, use the following steps to get macOS 26 up and going. You'll want to set aside a half hour or so to complete the update.\nIt's been a while since we've had a good Apple design controversy. Liquid Glass is the latest cause for outrage, and Apple's aware of it this time. The “visual motif,” as Apple calls it, is the primary change in this year's updates to the company's operating systems, and it's already come under some intense scrutiny since the announcement.\nTransparency is nothing new; in fact, there was already plenty of it in macOS. But Tahoe turns up the transparency to another level, in a way that makes it feel decidedly bold. The current “flat” design of macOS first rolled out back in 2014 with Yosemite, which had an anti-button approach to menus, instead favoring simple text and shapes in the user interface. With Liquid Glass, the tides have turned again, bringing back buttons to help objects stand out from the very low opacity of menus and interfaces. These buttons and outlines are all highlighted by the glass-like borders, which give it a slight 3D effect. That part I like.\nThe best demonstration of this is in the Menu Bar and Control Center. Control Center was already a bit of a mess, so I appreciate the new, simpler look, which swaps out the layers of segmentation into a series of circular buttons. And yes, the transparency is very notable, relying heavily on the frosted glass effect to maintain any kind of legibility. The entire Menu Bar across the top now disappears entirely, which is what Apple is referring to when it says it makes the screen feel bigger. I have to agree there, so long as you have a relatively simple wallpaper that doesn't obscure the text. The widgets have the same effect, though interestingly, when I changed the wallpaper, it filled in the background and removed the transparency. It's a necessary concession.\nUnfortunately, applications like Spotlight and Apps are transparent, and depending on what you have open underneath, it can look really distracting and ugly. I happened to have my Google Calendar open in dark mode, and the result was a sloppy mess. I can't imagine a reason why you'd want these to be transparent. I also don't like that apps with sidebars like Messages or Finder allow elements to be transparent underneath the Exit, Minimize, and Fullscreen buttons. This looks fine in some apps, like the new Games app, but in apps that are primarily text, it just looks cluttered.\nIf you use a Mac every day like I do, though, a lot of the smaller changes are what give it its distinctly fresh feeling. The icons are what you'll notice first, which is right where the controversy begins. The iconic (heh) Finder icon has, indeed, been tampered with—though they haven't been flipped like in the original concept. The colors are slightly different, though, and there's a nice, modern border around it to match the other icons.\nThe corner radius on nearly everything from buttons to windows has enlarged, giving everything a stronger cohesion and sense of unity. It'll take some getting used to in Finder, but I like how the redesigned Safari looks with its floating search bar at the top. There's even a new cursor for resizing windows.\nAll in all, the aesthetic changes to macOS haven't had quite as big an impact as on iOS, where Liquid Glass has proved to be a bit more problematic already, so much so that Apple dialed it back a bit. There will inevitably be areas where Apple may need to improve visibility, but I think the implementation in macOS Tahoe is relatively benign.\nThere are a few smaller design changes, such as the ability to change the color of folders or add an emoji to them. Control Center, located up top in the Menu Bar, has also been made completely transparent. More importantly, Apple has added tons more customization so you can add more quick settings to change. You can even add specific settings in commonly used apps such as Zoom.\nMacOS Tahoe also brings over a design tweak that came to iPhones last year: tint for icons, which applies a unified look to all your icons at once. Honestly, I'm surprised this came to macOS, because it wasn't well-received by reviewers. The setting for this can be found under Appearance in System Settings, and giving it a try myself, it didn't change my mind. It's as tacky as it was on iOS.\nThis is the feature I've been most excited to try out since it was announced, and admittedly, there's a lot to it. The Spotlight search tool has always been one of my favorite features in macOS, and I've been waiting for Apple to take it to the next level. In Tahoe, it borrows from the popular Mac app, Alfred, but goes above and beyond in terms of integration. It's smarter on just about every level, quickly offering up apps, documents, or even your clipboard history, which has to be the most practical use case so far, even if it's not quite as full-featured as Alfred.\nSpotlight can even now perform system actions and in-app actions, such as playing a podcast or starting a recording. You can fill out parameters such as who you're sending an email to—again, right in Spotlight! I still need to explore what I would depend on this for. But I can feel the potential.\nSpotlight gets greatly enhanced in Tahoe.\nHundreds of actions can now be triggered from Spotlight, like sending an email, creating a note, or playing a podcast.\nBut wait, there's more. There are even Quick Keys you can use to speed things up further. Type “sm” to send a message or “ar” to create a reminder. Think next-level key commands with these. You can set up your own Quick Keys, too, really expanding the capabilities and customization. For example, you can set up Quick Keys to take actions within an app that you're using, letting you quickly set up a task all from the keyboard. It's for the Mac nerds out there who already know every other key command.\nInterestingly, as part of the emphasis on Spotlight, Apple has replaced Launchpad with a new Apps shortcut in the dock. This is a change I like. Launchpad was a full-screen takeover, which felt a bit overcooked. That's why I often found myself using Spotlight to open apps much more often. Based on this change in macOS Tahoe, I'm guessing I'm not the only one. If only it weren't transparent.\nShortcuts can be a really powerful way of automating tasks on your Mac. With macOS Tahoe, these are upgraded by Apple Intelligence, letting you set up shortcuts like summarizing text or generating images. You can even tap into ChatGPT (or the on-device Neural Engine) if necessary, setting up chains of actions that could potentially be extremely useful. For example, you might create a Shortcut that compares notes from text in Notes from a lecture to an audio transcription, and then summarizes the differences using Apple Intelligence.\nThe new actions in Shortcuts.\nBonus points—you can now access these AI-powered shortcuts through the aforementioned Spotlight update.\nAs part of its ever-growing suite of Continuity features, the Phone app is now on Macs. Why put a Phone app on a device that doesn't have a cellular modem? It doesn't make a lot of sense on the surface, but remember, you can take calls from your iPhone directly to your Mac.\nThe app has all the same features on iOS 26, such as live translation in calls, new backgrounds for contacts, and automatically screened calls. Not surprisingly, all the changes to group chats are coming to the Mac Messages app.\nThe inclusion of the Phone app could point us in the direction of 5G MacBooks in the future, something Apple has resisted for a long time. While cellular laptops aren't exactly common these days, it feels more possible now that the Phone app is here. So who knows? Maybe the M6 MacBook Pros, whenever they launch, will have a surprise option for cellular connectivity to better make use of the Phone app (maybe with Apple's C1X modem). Microsoft announced a Surface Laptop 5G just a few months ago.\nLive Activities from an iPhone will appear in the Mac's menu bar.\nApple is also introducing Live Activities to the Mac, which will hand off an ongoing task from your iPhone, such as an Uber Eats order, and give you updates right in the Menu Bar on your Mac.\nThere are a couple of other features worth mentioning. One is improvements to gaming, with a dedicated Games app, similar to what will be in iPadOS 26 and iOS 26. It's perhaps the most useful here on the Mac, though, since the question of which games are available on Mac often comes up. It also allows Apple to highlight some of the bigger titles, like Cyberpunk 2077 or Assassin's Creed: Shadows.\nThe new Apple Games app.\nIt's pretty, I have to admit, even if it's not entirely useful as is. But it puts all your games in one place, from across your device, and centers the large, glorious game art. The more exciting part is the new Game Overlay, something that PC gamers usually have access to. The overlay lets you chat with friends, adjust settings, and more without having to exit the game. It should be noted that the transparent menus look particularly nice in this scenario.\nGame Overlay lets players adjust their settings, chat, or invite new players.\nSome smaller changes include the ability to capture audio recordings within the Notes app, the Journal app coming to the Mac for the first time, and a new Magnifier feature that zooms in with your connected webcam or camera."

    "content": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nApple introduced a rather drastic change to its operating-system naming conventions this year. What would've been watchOS 12 is now watchOS 26, since the company decided to stop labeling its operating systems sequentially and instead name them according to the fiscal year they are released. Every OS now, from iOS 26 to macOS 26, also has a new, overhauled display aesthetic called Liquid Glass, which makes certain apps, icons, buttons, and pop-ups look like frosted glass and other features look like raindrops.\nWatchOS 26 has new Apple Intelligence features, which are small and measured rather than big and sweeping—but for Apple Watch fans, the fact that there is now Apple Intelligence on your wrist at all might be enough. Here, I'll walk through some of the new tips and tricks you can now see on your Apple Watch. (If you want to read about it straight from Apple, you can do so here.)\nUpdated September 15, 2025: WatchOS 26 is now out. We tweaked the language in this story to reflect that, added details on how to download it, and added more info on new features.\nIs Your Apple Watch Compatible?\nApple's watchOS 26 is available for Apple Watches starting from the Series 6 or later. This includes the second-gen Apple Watch SE and all Apple Watch Ultra models. You must also have an iPhone 11 or later that can run iOS 26. If you want the Apple Intelligence features, you need to have an Apple Intelligence-enabled iPhone, which includes the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, all iPhone 16 models, and the latest iPhone 17 models.\nHow to Install WatchOS 26\nFirst, check that your phone and watch are fully charged and connected to Wi-Fi. Go to the Watch app on your iPhone and click Settings > General > Software Update. Select watchOS 26 (if it hasn't already automatically updated!). You're done!\nMost of the Liquid Glass redesigns have been optimized for the bigger screens of the Mac, iPhone, and iPad. But hey, look, the numerals on the clock face now have a translucent frost! You can also see slight specular highlights around the edges of the buttons when you look closely. Smart Stack—Apple's layered widget system—will also utilize Liquid Glass so as not to obscure the screen.\nWorkout Buddy uses all the exercise data accumulated by the Apple Watch—heart rate, pace, distance, etc.—and uses it to offer personalized, upbeat encouragement (“you crushed it!”) during your exercise session. Apple Intelligence analyzes your data to provide these insights and to use voice encouragement derived from Fitness+ trainers. It can also mark key moments, like running a mile particularly fast. It's available for just a few exercises, like indoor and outdoor walking or running, outdoor cycling, functional and traditional strength training, and HIIT—and yes, you can turn it off if the idea of a cheerleader in your ear is hell for you, too.\nThe Workout app itself has also undergone a redesign, with four buttons in the four corners of the watch face to make it easier to tap on each feature. Users can set up music and podcasts within the Workout app, and Apple Music can either select music or provide suggestions for an appropriate playlist.\nWatchOS 26 now offers two new health features. The first is a new Sleep Score, which takes into account the time you went to bed, the duration of your sleep, and the number of interruptions to classify your sleep on a five-point scale—either Excellent, High, OK, Low, or Very Low. When you click on Sleep Score in the Health app, you can also see your heart rate and respiratory rate while sleeping.\nThe update also adds the ability to track possible signs of hypertension. Undiagnosed hypertension, or high blood pressure, affects around one-third of all adults and can cause kidney disease, heart attacks, or stroke. The Watch now uses data from the optical heart rate monitor to check your data over 30 days for possible signs of hypertension and will notify the user. The studies were developed with studies of over 100,000 people, and the feature is now FDA-cleared.\nSmart Stack now incorporates more contextual data, like location and the user's routine, to provide more helpful tips. For example, if you arrive at the gym at your usual time, your Apple Watch may mark your location and slide a workout routine to the top of your Smart Stack.\nIf you own a Watch Series 9, Watch Series 10, or Apple Watch Ultra 2, you will now be able to use a new wrist-flick gesture (much like Double Tap) to dismiss notifications or incoming calls, silence timers, and return to the clock face. A machine-learning model uses data from the accelerometer and gyroscope to catch the user's wrist movement.\nThe Apple Watch now also supports Live Translation in Messages (again, you will need an Apple Intelligence-enabled iPhone). If your language is set to English, the watch will offer prompts in Messages, like suggesting Apple Cash if the user is asked for a donation. Call Screening and Hold Assist will also come to the phone app on the watch, letting users decide whether to take or decline calls or ask for more information.\nThere are new watch faces to choose from. Flow is the new watch face that takes advantage of Liquid Glass, with blobs of color that swirl through the clear glass numerals. Exactograph looks a bit like the Waypoint face that has been available on Apple Watch Ultra for some time, but is actually a reinterpretation of a traditional clock face. It separates the hours, minutes, and seconds, and you will also be able to see the ticking second hand on other watch faces.\nFinally, you will be able to use the Notes app on the watch, which may be more important to some of us than others."

    "content": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nNostalgic for beloved gadgets from your childhood? One easy and uncommon way to celebrate these gizmos is to frame them up on your wall. Grid Studios has been deconstructing old-school gadgets for 5 years now, and to celebrate its anniversary, the company is offering a 20 percent off sitewide discount with code GRID5, though the sale event ends September 17.\nGrid Studio\nGrid Studios\nI've linked to the Nintendo Game Boy Advance version, the 2001 handheld that was my first portable gaming console. But Grid has all sorts of products you can choose from, including the first-ever iPhone 2G, the Google Pixel, the Samsung Galaxy S, and even the first Android phone. It extends past phones, too, with the iPod, MacBook, Apple chips, and other game consoles.\nGrid says the products deconstructed in the art frame are original parts, and some of them may even show some wear and tear; however, the company uses fake batteries to prevent any hazards. Its studio is located in China, and it has warehouses in China, the US, and the Czech Republic. The frames come in two sizes, rectangular (11.7 x 16.4 inches) and square (13 x 13 inches).\nThe gadget is neatly laid out on the back of the frame, and there are labels pointing to and explaining what the parts are. On the Game Boy Advance, it highlights all of the buttons and internal parts, from the speaker and CPU to the L button and battery cover. At the top, you'll also find the year of the product's release (it's been 24 years since the Game Boy Advance launched!). Some of the pieces have extra text on them—the iPhones come with quotes from Steve Jobs.\nThese make great gifts, or a fun way to decorate a room or home office. There are preinstalled D-rings on the back of the frame, so hanging the piece up is an easy affair. You just have to peel off the plastic cover over the plexiglass. The danger is that once you buy one, you'll probably be ready to purchase another. Beats having these go to the landfill!"

    "title": "The Top New Features in Apple’s iOS 26 and iPadOS 26",
    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/apple-ios-26-and-ipados-26-top-new-features/",
    "content": "Your iPhone and iPad are getting a makeover with iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. No, you haven’t missed seven operating system upgrades since iOS 18 last year. Apple has changed the naming structure of its OS updates to make them all consistent—visionOS 26, watchOS 26, macOS 26—so they’re now tied to the year after their launch, similar to what car makers do when debuting new models.\nThe main highlight across all of Apple’s updates, first announced at WWDC 2025, revolves around the new look and feel of the interface, a design language the company calls Liquid Glass. Beyond that, there are several new features in iOS, from live translation in messages and call screening to the ability to search anything on your iPhone screen through Visual Intelligence. The Photos app is also getting its tabs back! More significant are the updates to iPadOS, which will now support windowed apps that are resizable and can be tiled, bringing it closer to the desktop computing experience people have been waiting for.\nI'll run through the top new features in both operating systems. Here's what you need to know.\nUpdated September 15, 2025: The update is officially out, and we've tweaked the language in this story to reflect that and added information on how to download it.\nIs Your iPhone or iPad Compatible\nEvery year, Apple cuts off a few older devices from downloading the latest iOS or iPadOS version. The reason is supposedly due to hardware age. (Apple typically supports iPhones and iPads for six to seven years.)\niPhones from 2019 and newer—the iPhone 11 and up, including the iPhone SE (2nd Gen)—will support iOS 26. The iPhones that received iOS 18 but are now cut off from the latest version are the iPhone XR and iPhone XS series from 2018. If you're unsure about your iPhone model, head to Settings > General > About and look at the model name.\niPads are a little more complicated, as the naming scheme fluctuates. Apple recently retired the “generations” and is now using the chipset to denote the model. You can figure out what model your iPad is by heading here. The 7th-gen iPad from 2019 seems to be the only one that will not receive the update compared to iPads that received iPadOS 18.\nHow to Install iOS 26 or iPadOS 26\nApple has released the final version of iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. Before installing, you should back up your devices. Head to Settings, tap your name at the top, and select iCloud. Then tap iCloud Backup, and tap Back Up Now. Read our How to Back Up Your iPhone or iPad guide for other methods and more details.\nWhen you're ready to update, make sure your iPhone is fully charged and connected to Wi-Fi. Then go to Settings > General > Software Update and wait for it to check for updates. Choose iOS 26 when you see the option. It'll request the update and then take some time to download it. Your iPhone will then automatically restart to complete the installation, so make sure you set aside several minutes for the whole process. That's it!\nWhat Happened to iOS 19?\nApple's previous iOS version was iOS 18 in 2024, but the company has decided to revamp its naming structure so that all of its platforms are consistent. That means iOS, iPadOS, macOS, visionOS, tvOS, and watchOS are all on version 26. Why 26? Apple is following the carmaker's playbook, naming the update for the last two digits of the following year. Most people download the latest iPhone OS version in December, even though Apple releases it in September; this way it continues to feel fresh right as the new year rolls around.\nLet's take a look at the top new features in iOS 26. You can read more about it directly from Apple here.\nApple has a new design language for the iPhone, the first major visual overhaul in years, and it's called Liquid Glass. It's very much like the Windows Aero theme from the Microsoft Vista days in 2006. The interface acts like glass, so pulling down the lock screen feels like you're moving a pane of glass, and you can see how the apps interact around it. There are even specular highlights on app icons that shift as the phone moves in your hand. Apple has also added some newer animations that feel bouncy, not unlike some of the new animations in Android 16. There's supposedly no change in performance or battery life to render these effects.\nThe iOS 26 home screen with an optional all-glass theme.\nYou can have the normal app icons with Liquid Glass, and you can even tint the apps just like last year. But there's a new option for “Clear” app icons, and everything in the interface switches to that all-glass look. To play around with it, tap and hold anywhere on the home screen, tap Edit > Customize, and choose Clear.\nOn the lock screen, the time adapts to the available space.\nOver on the lock screen, the time now adapts to the photo, stretching until it goes right behind the top of the subject for a depth effect. (Tap and hold on the lock screen and tap Customize to enable this. The stretched clock is only available in one style.)\nWhen new notifications come in, the subject in your photo shifts up so that the notifications don't block them. There's also a new way to turn 2D photos into a 3D effect in the Photos app, and you can apply those to the lock screen. (Tap and hold on the lock screen, tap Customize, and tap the Generate Spatial Scene icon.\nTaking a page from Google's Call Screen feature on Pixel phones, Apple has finally added its own version in iOS 26. Once you enable Call Screening, it'll automatically answer calls from unknown callers in the background without alerting you. Once the caller gives a reason for their call, your phone will ring, but you'll be able to see the response on the screen so you can decide whether you want to answer or not.\nYou may see an option to turn it on in the Phone app, but you can make sure by heading to Settings > Apps > Phone > Screen Unknown Callers and tapping Ask Reason for Calling or Silence. These will be marked as unknown callers and you can find voicemails from these callers by clicking on the top right icon in the Phone app.\nJust like Google's Hold for Me feature, Apple has a Hold Assist function that makes staying on hold more bearable. If you're trying to reach a company but hear the dreaded hold music, you can turn this feature on and won't have to pay super close attention to your phone. When the music is over and a live agent starts talking, you'll get a notification—handy if you need to wait more than 30 minutes just to reach a customer service rep. You can tap the three-dot icon during a call and choose Hold Assist to enable it. Your phone will make a sound when a human is on the other end.\nThe redesigned phone app in iOS 26.\nThese screening functions are also in the Messages and FaceTime apps with an “Unknown Senders” tab. To enable this, head to Settings > Apps > Messages > Screen Unknown Senders. You can approve these numbers and they'll show up in your main Messages view, or mark them as spam. (Some will automatically be screened as spam.)\nThe Phone app also has a new look, with your favorites up top and recent calls below. You'll be able to switch to the old Phone app user interface through a toggle on the top right of the app.\nYou can now get live translations from Apple's Messages, Phone, and FaceTime apps. We've seen similar versions of this technology from Samsung and Google on their respective phones over the last few years. In the Phone app, you can turn on a translation mode, and a voice will translate what the other person says and vice versa in real time. (You can toggle whether you need translation both ways or just for one language.)\nOver in the Messages app, you'll see translated text as a part of your message bubble when speaking with someone else, and in FaceTime, you'll get real-time translated subtitles. All of these happen on-device, so data doesn't leave your iPhone, and they'll also work when you're communicating with people using Android phones.\nLive Translation is integrated into Messages, FaceTime, and Phone. It can translate audio as well as text.\nAt the moment, Live Translation in Phone and FaceTime only works with one-on-one calls in English (UK and US), French (France), German, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain). Live Translation in Messages has slightly broader language support, including Chinese (simplified) and Japanese. Since there's now a Phone app on iPadOS and MacOS, you can still take advantage of these features if you answer on those platforms.\nVisual Intelligence debuted with Apple Intelligence as a way to have Siri understand the world around you through the iPhone's camera. It's now expanding to understand the context of your iPhone's screen. Very much like Google's Gemini, Visual Intelligence can identify what's on your screen and suggest specific actions.\nUnlike triggering Visual Intelligence and Siri with the Camera Control or Action Button, to trigger the onscreen contextual mode, you have to take a screenshot (these don't have to be saved if you tap the X icon on the top left). If you take a screenshot of an invitation someone sent you, for example, you'll see a suggestion to add it to your calendar with one tap. If you're looking at a PDF, a screenshot might suggest a summarization so you can get the highlights.\nBuilding on Apple Intelligence, visual intelligence now extends to a user’s iPhone screen, making it easy to search and take action across apps with anything they’re viewing.\nThere's even a feature very similar to Google Lens or Google's Circle to Search, where you can take a screenshot and then highlight a specific thing on the page you want to search via Google, or through another app that's installed on your phone that supports the feature, like Etsy. So you can highlight a vase, for example, and then find similar results via Google or similar shoppable vases on Etsy.\nGroup chats are finally getting typing indicators and polls (though the latter is exclusive to iMessage group chats). There's also the ability to add new background designs for messages to make them more personalized. If you're big on emoji, you might like the new ability to mix two emojis via Genmoji in the keyboard or in Apple's Image Playground app. (It's somewhat similar to Google's Emoji Kitchen.)\nConversations in Messages have background textures now.\nGroup chats get an overhaul.\nThere's a new app in iOS 26! The Games app is now your one-stop shop to see all the games you've ever bought on the App Store, and you can launch them right from this app. (There's even controller support so you can use a mobile controller to move through the user interface.) The app lets you discover new games, see what your friends are playing, and a Challenges tab lets you compete even with single-player games via a leaderboard.\nThere are several other features not mentioned here, but here are a few other highlights.\niPadOS 26 gets many of the same features as iOS 26, so I won't repeat things in this section, but let's take a look at specific new capabilities coming to iPads this fall. As always, you can get a deeper dive from Apple here.\niPads have become incredibly powerful over the past few years, but multitasking has been lackluster, making them feel inadequate as laptop replacements. That's changing now with the multitasking changes in iPadOS 26. Now apps support windowing, so you can have multiple apps on the screen in different sizes. Just resize them by dragging a corner of the app and arrange them wherever.\nApps can be tiled in different configurations.\nYou get Mac-style traffic light buttons too.\nThere are native window tiling options—a flick to the left or right will tile apps to the sides for easier split-screen, and you can even split apps into thirds or quarters. The familiar traffic light buttons from macOS are also available now on apps, and if you press and hold them, you'll see more options to arrange apps with a tap. Swipe up and hold, and your apps will spread out in Exposé mode, and you'll be able to revisit your grouped apps later, even if you switch to a full-screen app. There's now also a menu bar you can pull down from the top in any app, though the available options will depend on the app.\nBest of all, iPadOS now lets you handle more tasks in the background. Previously, if you were rendering a file in Final Cut, you'd have to keep it open for the render to complete. Now, that task can be done in the background, allowing you to switch to other apps for a true multitasking desktop experience.\nThe Files app has a new design that offers more info at a glance. There are resizable columns and collapsible folders, and you can set default apps for opening specific file types. You can also customize folders with different colors and emojis to make them visually distinct. Speaking of, you can put folders in the dock for speedier access.\nThe Files app has sortable, resizable columns.\nApple's Preview app from macOS is now available on iPadOS, allowing you to open, edit, and mark up PDFs or images. It works with the Apple Pencil, making it great for filling out text fields and signing documents.\nThe Preview app works with Apple Pencil."

    "title": "Russia Tests Hypersonic Missile at NATO’s Doorstep—and Shares the Video",
    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/russia-hypersonic-missile-test-nato-borders/",
    "content": "On Sunday, Russia released images of its launch of a 3M22 Zircon hypersonic missile from a frigate in the Barents Sea, in the Arctic Ocean, near NATO borders. The launch comes against a backdrop of rising tensions with the West, just days after several Russian drones violated the airspace of North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries Poland and Romania.\nThe Zircon test is part of the Zapad 2025 joint maneuvers with Belarus, a week of military exercises aimed at assessing defensive and coordination capabilities between the two allied countries. It also serves to show that Russia's military force has not lost its strength, despite heavy losses more than three years after the start of the invasion of Ukraine.\nIn the video originally shared on Telegram, the crew aboard the frigate Admiral Golovko fires the Zircon at a target in the Barents Sea, an area bounded to the west by the Norwegian Sea. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the target was destroyed in a direct hit by its hypersonic missile, which can reach a distance of up to 1,000 kilometers and travel at Mach 9—nine times the speed of sound.\nThe images also show exercises with Sukoi Su-34 supersonic fighter-bombers, a two-seater fighter-bomber that can carry up to eight tons of armament and can fly up to 2,485 miles (4,000 kilometers) without refueling (or more than 4,350 miles, or 7,000 km, with external tanks).\nThere is evidence that Russia has employed hypersonic missiles against civilian targets in Ukraine, such as the Zircon or Kinzhal, which are virtually impossible to intercept. This is not only because of their speed, but also because of their maneuvering capabilities, allowing them to change course mid-flight to evade defense systems (albeit in a limited way).\nRemnants of a Russian Zircon hypersonic missile, after it hit a five-story residential building in Kyiv during an aerial bombardment, November 17, 2024.\nThis week, NATO set off international alarms due to a series of Russian drone incursions into Polish and Romanian airspace, a violation that had not been recorded so far in the Russia-Ukraine war, at least not on this scale. On September 10, at least 19 drones from Russia invaded Polish airspace, being intercepted and shot down by NATO fighters with no major damage on the ground. The incident was described by the Polish government as an \"unprecedented violation\" and a “large-scale provocation,” expressions shared by Mark Rutte, NATO's secretary general.\nPoland then invoked Article 4 of the NATO Charter, which establishes a mechanism for consultation between NATO members “to exchange views and information and discuss issues before reaching agreement and taking action.” Following this debate among member countries, they launched Operation Eastern Sentinel, a military initiative to strengthen the defensive posture on the alliance's eastern flank through the deployment of advanced fighters and defense systems, among other measures, to counter missile and drone threats.\nThe alerts were triggered again on September 13, when Romania detected a drone, allegedly from Russia, in its airspace. Russian drone incursions into NATO airspace generated widespread international condemnation. The United States expressed support for the affected countries. “We consider this an unacceptable, regrettable and dangerous event,” said Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state. “No doubt the drones were intentionally launched. The question is whether they were intended to enter Poland.” The Russian government claimed it was not targeting Poland, while Belarus suggested the drones deviated from their initial trajectory.\nNotwithstanding the attempts to offer explanations, the joint Zapad 2025 military exercises between Russia and Belarus do little to reduce tensions in Eastern Europe. Although both nations insist that the exercises are defensive in nature, the proximity of the exercises to NATO borders, as well as tests of hypersonic missiles in the Arctic, raise new concerns among Atlantic Alliance member countries."

    "title": "Hundreds of Google AI Workers Were Fired Amid Fight Over Working Conditions",
    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/hundreds-of-google-ai-workers-were-fired-amid-fight-over-working-conditions/",
    "content": "More than 200 contractors who worked on evaluating and improving Google’s AI products have been laid off without warning in at least two rounds of layoffs last month. The move comes amid an ongoing fight over pay and working conditions, according to workers who spoke to WIRED.\nIn the past few years, Google has outsourced its AI rating work—which includes evaluating, editing, or rewriting the Gemini chatbot’s response to make it sound more human and “intelligent”—to thousands of contractors employed by Hitachi-owned GlobalLogic and other outsourcing companies. Most raters working at GlobalLogic are based in the US and deal with English-language content. Just as content moderators help purge and classify content on social media, these workers use their expertise, skill, and judgment to teach chatbots and other AI products, including Google’s search summaries feature called AI Overviews—the right responses on a wide range of subjects. Workers allege that the latest cuts come amid attempts to quash their protests over issues including pay and job insecurity.\nThese workers, who often are hired because of their specialist knowledge, had to have either a master’s or a PhD to join the super rater program, and typically include writers, teachers, and people from creative fields.\n“I was just cut off,” says Andrew Lauzon, who received an email with the news of his termination on August 15. “I asked for a reason, and they said ramp-down on the project—whatever that means.” He joined GlobalLogic in March 2024, where his work ranged from rating AI outputs to coming up with a variety of prompts to feed into the model.\nLauzon says this move by the company shows the precarity of such content moderation jobs. He alleges that GlobalLogic started regularly laying off its workers this year. “How are we supposed to feel secure in this employment when we know that we could go at any moment?” he added.\nWorkers still at the company claim they are increasingly concerned that they are being set up to replace themselves. According to internal documents viewed by WIRED, GlobalLogic seems to be using these human raters to train the Google AI system that could automatically rate the responses, with the aim of replacing them with AI.\nAt the same time, the company is also finding ways to get rid of current employees as it continues to hire new workers. In July, GlobalLogic made it mandatory for its workers in Austin, Texas, to return to office, according to a notice seen by WIRED. This has directly impacted several workers who either cannot afford to travel to the office due to financial constraints or cannot go to work due to disabilities or caregiving responsibilities.\nDespite handling work they describe as skilled and high-stakes, eight workers who spoke to WIRED say they are being underpaid and suffer from lack of job security and unfavorable working conditions. These alleged conditions have impacted worker morale and challenged the ability for people to execute their jobs well, sources say. Some contractors attempted to unionize earlier this year but claim those efforts were quashed. Now they allege that the company has retaliated against them. Two workers have filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging they were unfairly fired, one due to bringing up wage transparency issues, and the other for advocating for himself and his coworkers.\n“These individuals are employees of GlobalLogic or their subcontractors, not Alphabet,\" Courtenay Mencini, a Google spokesperson, said in a statement. \"As the employers, GlobalLogic and their subcontractors are responsible for the employment and working conditions of their employees. We take our supplier relations seriously and audit the companies we work with against our Supplier Code of Conduct.” GlobalLogic declined to comment.\nFor a decade, software company GlobalLogic had a team of “generalist raters” who would help rate Google’s search results. In the spring of 2023, Google asked GlobalLogic to assemble a team of “super raters” to evaluate its AI products, starting with AI Overviews.\nRicardo Levario, a teacher from Texas, was hired among the first batch of super raters. Back then he worked on Google’s “search generative experience,” where the search results would display an AI generated summary—now renamed AI Overviews. His job was to determine how well the model performed and rewrite its responses to make sure it was grounded and made better use of sources.\n“After the success [of this pilot], we learned that Google was interested in growing the program, and they were going to bring on cohorts of 20 people every week,” says Levario, adding that the company eventually ended up hiring as many as 2,000 super raters to work on Google’s AI. But problems began when GlobalLogic started using third-party contractors to ramp up hiring, Levario claims—because while GlobalLogic super raters’ pay ranged from $28 to $32 an hour, the super raters brought in via third-party contractors were paid $18 to $22 an hour for the same work. The company also has a few hundred “generalist raters” for its AI products who don’t necessarily have a higher degree like the super raters. One such generalist rater, Alex, who was hired in 2023 to rate the bot’s output based on the guidelines provided—which included “fluffier” questions like asking about the closest restaurant but also “not as savory” ones. She says that she hasn’t received a “notable pay increase” despite being pulled into “more demanding” projects. (Alex requested that WIRED identify her by first name only due to privacy concerns).\n“We as raters play an incredibly vital role, because the engineers between messing with the code and everything, they're not going to have the time to fine tune and get the feedback they need for the bot,” says Alex. “We’re like the lifeguards on the beach—we’re there to make sure nothing bad happens.” Alex was eventually able to secure a full time position with GlobalLogic, but she alleges that roughly 80 percent of her project folks continue to be on contract, without any benefits or paid time off.\nAt the end of 2023, workers created a WhatsApp group named Super Secret Secondary Location with around 80 members where some of them started discussing ways to organize. In the spring of 2024, some of these workers got together with the Alphabet Workers Union to discuss ways to create a GlobalLogic chapter for the AI raters to be able to demand better pay and working conditions. “We started building the movement underground,” says Levario. “We were essentially laying down the foundation for our union, developing our systems.” By December 2024, their chapter had 18 members.\nAround that time, workplace frustrations were only growing. Alex, along with several other workers, was pulled into a project a few months prior which she initially thought would lead to promotions. But, instead it led to intensified workplace stress. Alex says that in this project, their task timers were set at five minutes, raising concerns amongst her and her coworkers that they are “sacrificing quality at this point.” “I don't even keep count of how many I do in a day,” says Alex. “I just focus more on the timer than anything else—it's gone from mentally stimulating work to mind-numbing.” She added that she often does not reach that metric of completing each task within five minutes and that the company has been “threatening many of us with losing our job or the project in general if we don't get these numbers down.”\nIn January when a worker quit and left messages on their social channels and via email asking the workers to organize, things started to spiral. It “opened the floodgates,” and workers started having conversations about working conditions and wage parity on these social channels. “GlobalLogic’s reaction was to suppress the conversation, so they began deleting threads,” claims Levario. “One team lead even told us that we were violating company policies, which wasn't true—there was no company policy around that.” Later that month, to channel this worker agitation into action, Levario—who was one of the more vocal organizers—shared a pay and condition survey in the social channels. This worked, and the union membership grew from 18 to 60 by February.\nAfter this incident, however, things unraveled quickly. In the first week of February, many workers received an email saying that the company’s social channels—which was a way for all the remote workers to connect and forge friendships—were banned from use during work hours. These were Google’s chat spaces for all sorts of groups and interests—ranging from queer and gay people to video gamers and writers. “The social spaces helped us to feel less robotic and more human,” says Faith Frontera, about the company eliminating the use of social channels. “It’s important especially in a remote environment where you don’t get to see your coworkers face-to-face.” Frontera joined GlobalLogic as a generalist rater to annotate, proofread, and write responses for Gemini and Magi, which is Google’s new project to integrate AI in search.\nMany workers believe that the banning of social spaces was a direct result of workers discussing the pay parity. “I believe that [because] the union was happening, people were discussing their pay and stuff, painting a bad picture” of GlobalLogic, claims a super rater who joined the company two years ago, requesting anonymity to speak freely. “And so they did it as a means to stop us from communicating with one another and that’s what made the environment hostile.”\nEven as the company restricted the use of the social spaces, Levario continued to engage on the social channels, following which he was called into a meeting to warn him from using these spaces. Levario then filed a whistleblower complaint with Hitachi. Four days later, Levario received a response to his complaint and a calendar invite. During the five minute call, Levario was fired. They told him they were terminating his contract “for violating the social spaces policy.”\nLabor researchers allege this is how it typically plays out around the world with contracting agencies and workers. “This is the playbook,” says Mila Miceli, a research lead at DAIR Institute, an organization that works with AI data workers around the globe. “We have seen this in other places, almost every outsourcing company doing data work where workers have tried to collectivize and organize—this has been difficult. They have suffered retaliation.”\nGlobally, other AI contract workers are fighting back and organizing for better treatment and pay. Earlier this year, a group of Kenyan AI data labelers formed the Data Labelers Association in a bid to fight for better pay and working conditions and mental health support. At the same time, content moderators from around the world, who have faced and continue to deal with similar issues, formed the global trade union alliance in April. The Global Trade Union Alliance of Content Moderators includes workers from Kenya, Turkey, and Colombia.\nThose that remain working at GlobalLogic say they are afraid to speak up because they may lose their jobs. “It's just been kind of [an] oppressive atmosphere,” says Alex. “We can't really organize—we're afraid that if we talk we're going to get fired or laid off.”"

    "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/usa-today-enters-its-gen-ai-era-with-a-chatbot/",
    "content": "The publishing company behind USA Today and 220 other publications is today rolling out a chatbot-like tool called DeeperDive that can converse with readers, summarize insights from its journalism, and suggest new content from across its sites.\n“Visitors now have a trusted AI answer engine on our platform for anything they want to engage with, anything they want to ask,” said Mike Reed, CEO of Gannett and the USA Today Network, at the WIRED AI Power Summit in New York, an event that brought together voices from the tech industry, politics, and the world of media, “and it is performing really great.”\nMost publishers have a fraught relationship with AI, as the chatbots that trained on their content are now summarizing it and eating the traffic that search engines used to send them.\nReed said that Google’s AI Overview feature has dramatically cut traffic to publishers across the industry. “We are watching the same movie as everyone else is watching,” Reed said ahead of today’s announcement. “We can see some risk in the future to any content distribution model that is based primarily on SEO optimization.”\nLike other publishers, Gannett has signed some deals with AI companies, including Amazon and Perplexity, to license its content. The company actively blocks the web scrapers that crawl websites in order to steal content.\nDeeperDive represents a bet that harnessing the same generative artificial intelligence technology could help publishers capture readers attention by engaging with them in new ways.\nThe tool replaces a conventional search box and automatically suggests questions that readers might want to ask. For example, today it offers as one prompt, “How does Trump’s Fed policy affect the economy?”\nDeeperDive generates a short answer to the query along with relevant stories from across the USA Today network. Reed says it is crucial that DeeperDive bases its output on factually correct information and does not draw from opinion pieces. “We only look at our real journalism,” he says.\nThe interface of DeeperDive on the homepage of USA Today\nReed adds that his company hopes that the tool will also reveal more about readers’ interests. “That can help us from a revenue standpoint,” he said.\nDeeperDive was developed by the advertising company Taboola. Adam Singolda, Taboola’s CEO, says his firm developed DeeperDive by fine-tuning several open source models.\nSingolda says DeeperDive benefits from data gathered from across its own network of more than 600 million daily readers across around 11,000 publishers. He says the tool “grounds every answer in articles retrieved from our publisher partners and requires sentence-level citations to those sources” and will avoid generating an output if information from two sources seems to conflict.\nGannett’s CEO Reed said ahead of today’s event that, together with Taboola, his firm is interested in exploring agentic tools for readers’ shopping decisions. “Our audiences have a higher intent to purchase to begin with,” he says. “That's really the next step here.”"
